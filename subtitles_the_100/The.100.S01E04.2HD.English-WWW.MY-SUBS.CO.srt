1
00:00:01,173 --> 00:00:02,540
I was born in space.

2
00:00:02,817 --> 00:00:05,151
I've never felt the sun on my face

3
00:00:05,153 --> 00:00:08,621
or breathed real air
or floated in the water.

4
00:00:08,623 --> 00:00:11,824
None of us have. For 3 generations,

5
00:00:11,826 --> 00:00:14,794
The Ark has kept what's
left of the human race alive,

6
00:00:14,796 --> 00:00:17,797
but now our home is dying, and we

7
00:00:17,799 --> 00:00:20,133
are the last hope of mankind.

8
00:00:20,135 --> 00:00:23,669
100 prisoners sent on a
desperate mission to the ground.

9
00:00:23,671 --> 00:00:26,305
Each of us is here
because we broke the law.

10
00:00:26,307 --> 00:00:28,574
On the ground, there is no law.

11
00:00:28,576 --> 00:00:30,510
All we have to do is survive.

12
00:00:30,512 --> 00:00:31,944
But we will be tested,

13
00:00:31,946 --> 00:00:35,214
by the earth, by the secrets it hides,

14
00:00:35,216 --> 00:00:37,183
and most of all, by each other.

15
00:00:39,019 --> 00:00:40,786
Previously on "The 100"...

16
00:00:40,788 --> 00:00:42,021
The Ark is dying, Raven.

17
00:00:42,023 --> 00:00:44,757
I have to prove that earth is survivable.

18
00:00:44,759 --> 00:00:46,525
We have 9 days to get this ready

19
00:00:46,527 --> 00:00:49,195
so I can survive a drop.

20
00:00:49,197 --> 00:00:51,130
You know, my father, he begged for mercy

21
00:00:51,132 --> 00:00:52,698
when your father floated him.

22
00:00:52,700 --> 00:00:53,899
This is for my father.

23
00:00:56,971 --> 00:00:58,371
You're Charlotte, right?

24
00:00:58,373 --> 00:01:00,139
It's ok to be scared.

25
00:01:00,141 --> 00:01:01,507
Do you want to talk about it?

26
00:01:01,509 --> 00:01:04,009
It's my parents. They were floated

27
00:01:04,011 --> 00:01:06,479
and I see it in my dreams.

28
00:01:06,481 --> 00:01:09,081
No! Wake up, Charlotte.

29
00:01:09,083 --> 00:01:10,416
Does it happen often?

30
00:01:11,419 --> 00:01:12,985
Slay your demons, kid.

31
00:01:12,987 --> 00:01:15,101
Then you'll be able to sleep.

32
00:01:42,015 --> 00:01:44,182
You shouldn't be out here alone.

33
00:01:44,184 --> 00:01:45,617
What if I was a grounder?

34
00:01:47,053 --> 00:01:48,854
They got Wells just outside the wall.

35
00:01:48,856 --> 00:01:50,222
Says the guy who just spent another night

36
00:01:50,224 --> 00:01:51,923
exploring the woods all by himself.

37
00:01:51,925 --> 00:01:55,127
But I'm reckless. And irresponsible.

38
00:01:56,929 --> 00:01:58,263
I got you something.

39
00:02:01,300 --> 00:02:03,235
Where did you get this?

40
00:02:03,237 --> 00:02:04,503
The art supply store.

41
00:02:10,276 --> 00:02:11,977
I know when we were kids...

42
00:02:13,546 --> 00:02:19,050
Wells was always giving me ink, charcoal,

43
00:02:19,052 --> 00:02:21,586
just anything I could draw with, really.

44
00:02:24,223 --> 00:02:25,890
I found out later that he was trading

45
00:02:25,892 --> 00:02:27,592
his own stuff to give it to me.

46
00:02:29,962 --> 00:02:31,563
He didn't want me to know that, either.

47
00:02:34,100 --> 00:02:35,667
He let me hate him

48
00:02:35,669 --> 00:02:37,435
so that I wouldn't hate my mother.

49
00:02:40,306 --> 00:02:41,539
I know.

50
00:02:45,110 --> 00:02:46,978
My mother killed my father.

51
00:02:53,886 --> 00:02:56,921
Just wish there was something I could do.

52
00:02:58,657 --> 00:03:01,726
To tell her I know.
Make her feel what I'm...

53
00:03:07,499 --> 00:03:08,800
Where are you going?

54
00:03:08,802 --> 00:03:10,334
To make her feel it.

55
00:03:26,518 --> 00:03:28,853
No! No.

56
00:03:29,755 --> 00:03:32,156
No. Hell no. No.

57
00:03:40,065 --> 00:03:42,099
No. Th... this isn't right.

58
00:03:44,169 --> 00:03:45,336
Abby.

59
00:03:46,538 --> 00:03:47,705
No.

60
00:03:48,507 --> 00:03:49,740
Abby.

61
00:03:54,412 --> 00:03:56,547
Ok. It's not conclusive.

62
00:03:56,549 --> 00:04:00,184
Just because her wristband went out

63
00:04:00,186 --> 00:04:04,822
doesn't mean... ok.

64
00:04:04,824 --> 00:04:07,524
It's the first terminated
signal in over a week.

65
00:04:07,526 --> 00:04:10,961
We can still assume that
things are stabilizing on earth.

66
00:04:10,963 --> 00:04:12,196
We should assume that.

67
00:04:17,535 --> 00:04:20,871
I need an analysis of Clarke's
vital signs for the past two days.

68
00:04:20,873 --> 00:04:22,573
- Abby...
- Just have it ready for me

69
00:04:22,575 --> 00:04:23,740
when I get back.

70
00:04:29,480 --> 00:04:31,915
Yes! I did it.

71
00:04:31,917 --> 00:04:33,550
It's still operational.

72
00:04:39,757 --> 00:04:42,559
What? Monty needed a working wristband.

73
00:04:42,561 --> 00:04:45,128
And you needed to punish your mother.

74
00:04:45,130 --> 00:04:46,596
Look, they're running out of air,

75
00:04:46,598 --> 00:04:48,098
and we need their help.

76
00:04:48,100 --> 00:04:50,100
My mother thinking I'm
dead is only temporary.

77
00:04:50,102 --> 00:04:51,168
Not if I can't patch it through

78
00:04:51,170 --> 00:04:52,636
the dropship mainframe.

79
00:04:53,838 --> 00:04:55,272
I can do it.

80
00:04:55,274 --> 00:04:57,274
We'll be talking to The Ark by nightfall.

81
00:05:14,225 --> 00:05:16,292
This section should be
finished by tomorrow.

82
00:05:20,631 --> 00:05:21,798
Hey!

83
00:05:23,768 --> 00:05:25,568
You think the grounders
are just gonna sit around

84
00:05:25,570 --> 00:05:27,270
and wait for us to finish the wall?

85
00:05:27,272 --> 00:05:28,638
Maybe we should let the little girl

86
00:05:28,640 --> 00:05:30,206
do the lifting for you, huh?

87
00:05:30,208 --> 00:05:33,843
I just need some water,
ok? Then I'll be fine.

88
00:05:33,845 --> 00:05:37,180
Murphy, get this guy some water.

89
00:05:37,182 --> 00:05:38,882
Hey, you got this?

90
00:05:42,186 --> 00:05:43,386
I'm just kidding.

91
00:05:55,934 --> 00:05:59,702
Uhh! What the hell is
wrong with you, Murphy?

92
00:05:59,704 --> 00:06:00,870
Look at you!

93
00:06:02,639 --> 00:06:04,974
You wanted a water break.

94
00:06:04,976 --> 00:06:06,909
Get back to work.

95
00:06:15,152 --> 00:06:16,485
Look, we're already there.

96
00:06:16,487 --> 00:06:19,221
Just a few steps, ok?

97
00:06:19,223 --> 00:06:21,324
One foot in front of the other.

98
00:06:25,495 --> 00:06:27,797
Hey. What's wrong?

99
00:06:27,799 --> 00:06:31,333
Hmm? Oh, nothing. I'm good.

100
00:06:31,335 --> 00:06:33,235
Jasper, it's been a week, ok?

101
00:06:33,237 --> 00:06:34,937
You've been given a second chance.

102
00:06:34,939 --> 00:06:37,106
You gotta use it.

103
00:06:39,209 --> 00:06:40,442
Octavia?

104
00:06:42,679 --> 00:06:43,846
Octavia?

105
00:06:44,915 --> 00:06:47,449
Octavia! Octavia, are you ok?

106
00:06:48,719 --> 00:06:50,386
Hey, jerk!

107
00:06:51,688 --> 00:06:53,389
Get the hell out of here.

108
00:06:53,391 --> 00:06:55,224
Jasper, come on.

109
00:06:55,226 --> 00:06:56,925
There's nothing to be afraid of.

110
00:07:24,120 --> 00:07:25,220
Councillor.

111
00:07:25,222 --> 00:07:26,421
Councillor.

112
00:07:26,423 --> 00:07:28,624
Are you headed to Mecha Station?

113
00:07:29,792 --> 00:07:31,593
Yes, as a matter of fact, I am.

114
00:07:32,462 --> 00:07:35,964
You've been down there
9 times in the past week.

115
00:07:35,966 --> 00:07:37,799
Is there something I
should be made aware of?

116
00:07:38,968 --> 00:07:40,936
Are you tracking me, Kane?

117
00:07:40,938 --> 00:07:42,771
I'm tracking everybody, Abby.

118
00:07:44,073 --> 00:07:45,373
Mind if I join you?

119
00:07:45,375 --> 00:07:47,242
Not at all. But you're gonna

120
00:07:47,244 --> 00:07:48,844
have to be inoculated.

121
00:07:48,846 --> 00:07:50,412
Inoculated?

122
00:07:50,414 --> 00:07:52,414
A mechanic came down with strep last week.

123
00:07:52,416 --> 00:07:54,282
She's fine now, but I'm still

124
00:07:54,284 --> 00:07:57,219
checking the bacterial
levels in the station.

125
00:07:57,221 --> 00:07:58,920
We don't want another outbreak.

126
00:08:01,223 --> 00:08:02,490
We can stop by sick bay on the way.

127
00:08:02,492 --> 00:08:03,658
That's all right.

128
00:08:05,294 --> 00:08:06,728
I don't want to slow you down.

129
00:08:06,730 --> 00:08:09,964
Just... keep me informed.

130
00:08:11,767 --> 00:08:13,134
Absolutely.

131
00:08:21,311 --> 00:08:24,212
How soon can you get
this thing ready to drop?

132
00:08:24,214 --> 00:08:25,914
I'm still scraping up parts

133
00:08:25,916 --> 00:08:28,783
to fabricate a pressure regulator.

134
00:08:28,785 --> 00:08:30,285
We got two more days, right?

135
00:08:30,287 --> 00:08:32,353
Can we launch without that part?

136
00:08:32,355 --> 00:08:34,289
We could launch, but we'll be dead

137
00:08:34,291 --> 00:08:35,623
before we get to the ground.

138
00:08:35,625 --> 00:08:37,392
And I mean bad dead.

139
00:08:37,394 --> 00:08:38,660
Ruptured lungs,

140
00:08:38,662 --> 00:08:40,028
air bubbles in the brain.

141
00:08:40,030 --> 00:08:41,329
We need that part.

142
00:08:41,331 --> 00:08:43,197
Why? What's wrong? Did something change?

143
00:08:45,634 --> 00:08:47,602
Clarke's wristband signal went out.

144
00:08:52,007 --> 00:08:54,275
Yeah, but that doesn't
mean anything, right?

145
00:08:54,277 --> 00:08:56,010
She took it off like the rest of them.

146
00:09:01,884 --> 00:09:03,384
Ok.

147
00:09:03,386 --> 00:09:05,820
I can get a pressure regulator. Today.

148
00:09:05,822 --> 00:09:07,655
How?

149
00:09:07,657 --> 00:09:09,390
The less you know, the better.

150
00:09:18,834 --> 00:09:21,736
This knife was made of
metal from the dropship.

151
00:09:21,738 --> 00:09:23,204
What do you mean?

152
00:09:23,206 --> 00:09:24,605
Who else knows about this?

153
00:09:24,607 --> 00:09:26,941
No one. We brought it straight here.

154
00:09:26,943 --> 00:09:28,109
Clarke?

155
00:09:29,411 --> 00:09:31,879
It means the grounders didn't kill Wells.

156
00:09:32,881 --> 00:09:34,248
It was one of us.

157
00:09:36,918 --> 00:09:38,352
So, there's a murderer in the camp?

158
00:09:38,354 --> 00:09:41,288
There's more than one
murderer in this camp.

159
00:09:41,290 --> 00:09:43,557
This isn't news. We need to keep it quiet.

160
00:09:46,695 --> 00:09:48,062
Get out of my way, Bellamy.

161
00:09:48,064 --> 00:09:49,396
Be smart about this.

162
00:09:49,398 --> 00:09:50,764
Look at what we've achieved...

163
00:09:50,766 --> 00:09:51,932
the wall, the patrols.

164
00:09:51,934 --> 00:09:53,534
Like it or not, thinking the grounders

165
00:09:53,536 --> 00:09:55,069
killed Wells is good for us.

166
00:09:55,071 --> 00:09:56,837
Oh, good for you, you mean.

167
00:09:56,839 --> 00:09:58,238
What... keep people afraid

168
00:09:58,240 --> 00:09:59,373
and they'll work for you?

169
00:09:59,375 --> 00:10:00,908
- Is that it?
- Yeah, that's it.

170
00:10:00,910 --> 00:10:02,543
But it's good for all of us.

171
00:10:02,545 --> 00:10:04,711
Fear of the grounders
is building that wall.

172
00:10:04,713 --> 00:10:06,346
And besides, what are you gonna do...

173
00:10:06,348 --> 00:10:08,949
just walk out there and ask
the killer to step forward?

174
00:10:08,951 --> 00:10:10,250
You don't even know whose knife that is.

175
00:10:10,252 --> 00:10:11,418
Oh, really?

176
00:10:12,387 --> 00:10:15,022
J.M. John Murphy.

177
00:10:15,024 --> 00:10:16,757
The people have a right to know.

178
00:10:20,595 --> 00:10:22,796
No water till this section is up!

179
00:10:24,065 --> 00:10:26,533
What? What are you starting at, huh?

180
00:10:26,535 --> 00:10:28,402
You son of a bitch!

181
00:10:28,404 --> 00:10:29,436
What's your problem?

182
00:10:29,438 --> 00:10:30,637
Recognize this?

183
00:10:31,873 --> 00:10:33,206
It's my knife. Where'd you find it?

184
00:10:33,208 --> 00:10:36,409
Where you dropped it
after you killed Wells.

185
00:10:36,411 --> 00:10:37,611
Where I what?

186
00:10:40,148 --> 00:10:42,082
The grounders killed Wells, not me.

187
00:10:42,084 --> 00:10:43,416
I know what you did,

188
00:10:43,418 --> 00:10:44,784
and you're gonna pay for it.

189
00:10:44,786 --> 00:10:46,686
Really?

190
00:10:46,688 --> 00:10:48,755
Bellamy, you really believe this crap?

191
00:10:49,924 --> 00:10:52,659
You threatened to kill
him. We all heard you.

192
00:10:52,661 --> 00:10:53,627
You hated Wells.

193
00:10:53,629 --> 00:10:55,996
Plenty of people hated Wells.

194
00:10:55,998 --> 00:10:58,298
His father was the
chancellor that locked us up.

195
00:10:58,300 --> 00:10:59,332
Yeah, but you're the only one who

196
00:10:59,334 --> 00:11:00,667
got in a knife fight with him.

197
00:11:00,669 --> 00:11:02,268
Yeah, I didn't kill him then, either.

198
00:11:02,270 --> 00:11:03,970
Tried to kill Jasper, too.

199
00:11:07,074 --> 00:11:08,274
Come on. This is ridiculous.

200
00:11:08,276 --> 00:11:09,542
I don't have to answer to you.

201
00:11:09,544 --> 00:11:11,511
I don't have to answer to anyone.

202
00:11:11,513 --> 00:11:12,679
Come again?

203
00:11:16,951 --> 00:11:19,452
Bellamy, look, I'm telling you, man.

204
00:11:19,454 --> 00:11:20,954
I didn't do this.

205
00:11:20,956 --> 00:11:23,356
They found his fingers on
the ground with your knife.

206
00:11:25,125 --> 00:11:28,995
Is this the kind of society that we want?

207
00:11:28,997 --> 00:11:30,430
You say there should be no rules.

208
00:11:30,432 --> 00:11:31,931
Does that mean that we can kill each other

209
00:11:31,933 --> 00:11:33,599
without... without punishment?

210
00:11:33,681 --> 00:11:35,915
I already told you. I didn't kill anyone.

211
00:11:35,917 --> 00:11:37,049
I say we float him.

212
00:11:37,051 --> 00:11:38,784
Yeah.

213
00:11:38,786 --> 00:11:39,986
That's not what I'm saying.

214
00:11:39,988 --> 00:11:41,687
Why not? He deserves to float.

215
00:11:41,689 --> 00:11:42,722
It's justice.

216
00:11:42,724 --> 00:11:44,390
Revenge isn't justice.

217
00:11:44,472 --> 00:11:46,305
It's justice. Float him!

218
00:11:53,814 --> 00:11:56,048
No! Get off him!

219
00:11:59,352 --> 00:12:00,886
Get off of him!

220
00:12:09,596 --> 00:12:10,763
Let him go!

221
00:12:25,779 --> 00:12:27,546
You can't do this!

222
00:12:29,516 --> 00:12:30,916
Get off me.

223
00:12:33,787 --> 00:12:34,953
No!

224
00:12:35,855 --> 00:12:37,055
No!

225
00:12:38,758 --> 00:12:40,325
You can stop this!

226
00:12:40,327 --> 00:12:41,860
They'll listen to you!

227
00:12:41,862 --> 00:12:44,263
Bellamy! You should do it.

228
00:12:44,265 --> 00:12:45,597
Bel-la-my!

229
00:12:52,605 --> 00:12:53,872
I saw you in the woods with Atom.

230
00:12:53,874 --> 00:12:55,607
I know you're not a killer.

231
00:12:56,743 --> 00:12:59,644
Bellamy, don't do this. Don't...

232
00:13:00,580 --> 00:13:01,880
Don't. Bellamy.

233
00:13:06,953 --> 00:13:09,421
You can't do this, Bellamy.

234
00:13:17,831 --> 00:13:19,064
No, Bellamy, no!

235
00:13:19,066 --> 00:13:20,599
This is on you, princess.

236
00:13:20,601 --> 00:13:22,100
You should've kept your mouth shut.

237
00:13:22,102 --> 00:13:23,902
What the hell are you doing?

238
00:13:23,904 --> 00:13:25,437
Cut him down! Charlotte,

239
00:13:25,439 --> 00:13:27,305
get out of here now! Cut him down!

240
00:13:27,307 --> 00:13:28,506
Get out of my way.

241
00:13:29,342 --> 00:13:30,742
Stop! Ok?

242
00:13:30,744 --> 00:13:32,477
Murphy didn't kill Wells!

243
00:13:34,447 --> 00:13:36,614
- I did!
- Oh, my God.

244
00:14:00,460 --> 00:14:01,493
It's not meal time yet.

245
00:14:01,495 --> 00:14:02,494
I'm not hungry.

246
00:14:02,496 --> 00:14:03,929
I'm here to trade.

247
00:14:03,931 --> 00:14:05,697
Before you tell me I'm in the wrong place,

248
00:14:05,699 --> 00:14:07,332
just let Nygel know it's her little bird.

249
00:14:07,334 --> 00:14:09,067
Well, well, well.

250
00:14:11,938 --> 00:14:14,172
How long has it been, little bird?

251
00:14:14,174 --> 00:14:15,807
I need a pressure regulator.

252
00:14:15,809 --> 00:14:17,209
What for?

253
00:14:17,211 --> 00:14:18,644
Regulating pressure.

254
00:14:18,646 --> 00:14:20,012
That's good.

255
00:14:20,014 --> 00:14:22,614
I see you got your mom's sense of humor.

256
00:14:22,616 --> 00:14:23,949
What do you want for it?

257
00:14:23,951 --> 00:14:26,251
Oh, I don't move machine parts anymore.

258
00:14:26,253 --> 00:14:27,652
It's too dangerous.

259
00:14:27,654 --> 00:14:29,721
How about settling for some

260
00:14:29,723 --> 00:14:31,623
herb and moonshine like everybody else?

261
00:14:31,625 --> 00:14:32,624
Save the act for someone

262
00:14:32,626 --> 00:14:34,826
who doesn't know better.

263
00:14:34,828 --> 00:14:36,495
Just tell me what it's gonna take.

264
00:14:40,132 --> 00:14:43,501
I owe a favor to the chief of electrical,

265
00:14:43,503 --> 00:14:45,036
and he's got a thing for

266
00:14:45,038 --> 00:14:48,340
tough, pretty girls like you.

267
00:14:50,509 --> 00:14:51,676
You're joking, right?

268
00:14:51,678 --> 00:14:54,079
I never joke about business, Raven.

269
00:14:54,081 --> 00:14:56,147
Kane's watching my every move,

270
00:14:56,149 --> 00:14:58,149
so, if I'm gonna do this,

271
00:14:58,151 --> 00:15:00,318
you're gonna need to
make it worth my while.

272
00:15:00,320 --> 00:15:02,353
By screwing the chief of electrical?

273
00:15:04,924 --> 00:15:06,057
I can't do that.

274
00:15:06,059 --> 00:15:07,091
Then I guess you don't need to

275
00:15:07,093 --> 00:15:08,593
regulate pressure as badly

276
00:15:08,595 --> 00:15:10,628
as you thought you did.

277
00:15:10,630 --> 00:15:13,231
Go float yourself, Nygel.

278
00:15:13,233 --> 00:15:14,899
You know, your mother

279
00:15:14,901 --> 00:15:16,467
would've taken that deal.

280
00:15:17,836 --> 00:15:22,207
In fact, she did. Many times.

281
00:15:22,509 --> 00:15:24,642
Don't you dare talk
about my mother that way!

282
00:15:24,644 --> 00:15:26,878
- Little girl.
- No! I'll float you, Nygel!

283
00:15:26,880 --> 00:15:27,879
Get off me!

284
00:15:27,881 --> 00:15:29,580
Bye, little bird!

285
00:15:31,517 --> 00:15:33,351
Bring out the girl, Bellamy!

286
00:15:33,353 --> 00:15:34,519
Why, Charlotte?

287
00:15:34,521 --> 00:15:36,154
I was just trying to slay my demons,

288
00:15:36,156 --> 00:15:37,622
like you told me.

289
00:15:37,624 --> 00:15:39,924
What the hell is she talking about?

290
00:15:39,926 --> 00:15:41,058
She misunderstood me.

291
00:15:41,060 --> 00:15:42,827
Charlotte, that is not what I meant.

292
00:15:42,829 --> 00:15:44,562
Bring the girl out now!

293
00:15:44,564 --> 00:15:45,897
Please don't let them hurt me.

294
00:15:45,899 --> 00:15:48,199
If you guys have any
bright ideas, speak up.

295
00:15:51,169 --> 00:15:52,203
Now you stay quiet.

296
00:15:52,205 --> 00:15:53,504
Those are your boys out there.

297
00:15:53,506 --> 00:15:54,739
This is not my fault.

298
00:15:54,741 --> 00:15:56,173
If she had listened to me, those idiots

299
00:15:56,175 --> 00:15:57,708
would still be building the wall.

300
00:15:57,710 --> 00:16:00,711
You want to build a society, princess?

301
00:16:00,713 --> 00:16:02,980
Let's build a society. Bring her out.

302
00:16:02,982 --> 00:16:05,182
No! Please, Bellamy.

303
00:16:06,318 --> 00:16:08,953
Charlotte, hey, it's gonna be ok.

304
00:16:08,955 --> 00:16:11,288
Just stay with them.

305
00:16:15,560 --> 00:16:17,661
Well, well, well. Look
who decided to join us.

306
00:16:17,663 --> 00:16:19,864
Dial it down and back off.

307
00:16:19,866 --> 00:16:23,434
Or what? What are you
gonna do about me? Hang me?

308
00:16:23,436 --> 00:16:26,604
I was just giving the
people what they wanted.

309
00:16:26,606 --> 00:16:29,340
Yeah. Yeah, that's a good idea.

310
00:16:29,342 --> 00:16:30,808
Why don't we do that right now?

311
00:16:32,043 --> 00:16:33,177
So, who here wants to see

312
00:16:33,179 --> 00:16:35,312
the real murderer hung up?

313
00:16:35,314 --> 00:16:36,680
All in favor?

314
00:16:43,321 --> 00:16:44,521
I see.

315
00:16:45,790 --> 00:16:49,026
So, it's ok to string me up for nothing,

316
00:16:49,028 --> 00:16:51,361
but when this little bitch confesses,

317
00:16:51,363 --> 00:16:52,830
you all let her walk?

318
00:16:55,667 --> 00:16:58,035
Cowards! All of you are cowards!

319
00:16:58,037 --> 00:16:59,303
Hey, Murphy! Murphy.

320
00:17:00,238 --> 00:17:01,505
It's over.

321
00:17:06,878 --> 00:17:08,178
Whatever you say, boss.

322
00:17:12,383 --> 00:17:14,251
Son of a bitch! Hey!

323
00:17:15,620 --> 00:17:16,920
Come on. Let's get the girl.

324
00:17:20,491 --> 00:17:22,292
Charlotte!

325
00:17:22,294 --> 00:17:24,895
Charlotte, I know you can hear me!

326
00:17:24,897 --> 00:17:27,397
And when I find you, you are gonna pay!

327
00:18:07,075 --> 00:18:08,275
Come on.

328
00:18:09,477 --> 00:18:10,711
I'll be right back.

329
00:18:12,747 --> 00:18:13,947
All those people out there?

330
00:18:13,949 --> 00:18:15,749
Oxygen deprivation.

331
00:18:15,751 --> 00:18:18,185
It's just the beginning. Why are you here?

332
00:18:18,187 --> 00:18:20,220
I messed up. I can't get the part.

333
00:18:20,222 --> 00:18:21,488
Nygel wants me to...

334
00:18:21,490 --> 00:18:22,756
You went to Nygel?

335
00:18:22,758 --> 00:18:24,091
Yeah.

336
00:18:24,093 --> 00:18:26,894
Kane's been trying to get her for years.

337
00:18:26,896 --> 00:18:28,896
Did anybody see you?

338
00:18:28,898 --> 00:18:30,264
I don't know.

339
00:18:30,266 --> 00:18:32,165
No. Abby, I'm trying to tell you.

340
00:18:32,167 --> 00:18:33,867
We can't launch today.

341
00:18:33,869 --> 00:18:35,636
Are you sure Nygel has the part?

342
00:18:35,638 --> 00:18:38,272
- She can get one, yeah.
- Ok. I'll take care of it.

343
00:18:39,040 --> 00:18:40,340
What are you gonna do?

344
00:18:42,610 --> 00:18:44,144
The less you know, the better.

345
00:18:55,123 --> 00:18:56,790
Hello, Dr. Griffin.

346
00:18:56,792 --> 00:18:58,158
Nygel.

347
00:19:00,928 --> 00:19:04,331
Morphine. What do you want for it?

348
00:19:04,333 --> 00:19:06,533
Pressure regulator.

349
00:19:06,535 --> 00:19:09,069
I underestimated Raven.

350
00:19:09,071 --> 00:19:10,237
How does a girl like that get

351
00:19:10,239 --> 00:19:11,938
such a well-connected benefactor?

352
00:19:11,940 --> 00:19:14,107
You have 3 seconds to decide.

353
00:19:14,109 --> 00:19:15,709
Do we have a deal or not?

354
00:19:16,811 --> 00:19:18,345
Attention. The mess hall

355
00:19:18,347 --> 00:19:22,515
will be closed tomorrow from
1100 hours to 1200 hours.

356
00:19:25,352 --> 00:19:27,854
It's gonna be night soon,
Finn. Where are we going?

357
00:19:29,363 --> 00:19:30,897
At least tell me you have a plan

358
00:19:30,899 --> 00:19:32,232
and we're not just wandering

359
00:19:32,234 --> 00:19:33,566
aimlessly through the woods.

360
00:19:33,568 --> 00:19:35,101
I have a plan.

361
00:19:36,470 --> 00:19:38,104
What the hell do you think you're doing?

362
00:19:39,907 --> 00:19:42,208
Just because we saved you
doesn't mean you're forgiven.

363
00:19:42,210 --> 00:19:43,443
Got it?

364
00:19:45,112 --> 00:19:46,279
Clarke.

365
00:19:47,348 --> 00:19:48,548
What?

366
00:19:49,416 --> 00:19:50,883
She's just a kid.

367
00:19:50,885 --> 00:19:55,021
She's a killer. You
killed someone, Charlotte.

368
00:19:55,023 --> 00:19:56,622
Ended his life.

369
00:19:56,624 --> 00:19:59,859
Did you stop to think about
that for even one second?

370
00:19:59,891 --> 00:20:02,692
Look at me! You can't just kill someone

371
00:20:02,694 --> 00:20:04,294
to make yourself feel better.

372
00:20:11,168 --> 00:20:13,002
Charlotte!

373
00:20:13,004 --> 00:20:16,072
Clarke and Finn can't save you.

374
00:20:16,074 --> 00:20:17,373
We should run.

375
00:20:17,375 --> 00:20:19,709
Yeah, that's one way to go.

376
00:20:19,711 --> 00:20:21,344
I like my plan better.

377
00:20:25,916 --> 00:20:27,083
Get in.

378
00:20:28,218 --> 00:20:29,418
Get in.

379
00:20:57,581 --> 00:21:00,115
Finn, what is this place?

380
00:21:01,251 --> 00:21:05,221
For now, it's home.

381
00:21:17,571 --> 00:21:19,471
I can't believe you kept this place quiet.

382
00:21:19,473 --> 00:21:20,739
Come on, Clarke.

383
00:21:20,741 --> 00:21:22,007
What would be the point of telling anybody?

384
00:21:22,009 --> 00:21:23,475
Some of this stuff could be useful.

385
00:21:23,477 --> 00:21:25,044
Like what? There's no weapons.

386
00:21:25,046 --> 00:21:26,812
All the food expired, like, 90 years ago.

387
00:21:26,814 --> 00:21:27,813
Yeah, but we could repurpose.

388
00:21:27,815 --> 00:21:29,348
Share with the group.

389
00:21:29,350 --> 00:21:31,283
You can share this with
the group if you'd like.

390
00:21:38,458 --> 00:21:39,658
What'd you find?

391
00:21:42,028 --> 00:21:43,295
Well...

392
00:21:45,565 --> 00:21:48,667
Looks like they never made it here.

393
00:21:48,669 --> 00:21:52,104
No. I figure the bombs
took them by surprise.

394
00:21:53,940 --> 00:21:57,876
All this preparation. What a waste.

395
00:22:00,613 --> 00:22:04,449
I don't know. Maybe they were lucky.

396
00:22:05,952 --> 00:22:09,454
They couldn't have lived more
than a few years down here,

397
00:22:09,456 --> 00:22:11,323
then when they ran out of food

398
00:22:11,325 --> 00:22:13,692
or lost their minds,

399
00:22:13,694 --> 00:22:15,660
they would've opened the doors and

400
00:22:15,662 --> 00:22:18,497
been dead within a few days.

401
00:22:18,499 --> 00:22:20,131
Back then, maybe sooner.

402
00:22:25,071 --> 00:22:26,204
Anyway.

403
00:22:29,508 --> 00:22:31,242
What are we gonna do about her?

404
00:22:33,879 --> 00:22:35,280
If I hadn't confronted Murphy,

405
00:22:35,282 --> 00:22:37,048
none of this would have happened.

406
00:22:37,050 --> 00:22:38,817
How could you know it'd go down like that?

407
00:22:38,819 --> 00:22:40,018
Bellamy knew.

408
00:22:42,521 --> 00:22:44,789
We think the grounders are a threat.

409
00:22:44,791 --> 00:22:46,424
Now we're killing each other.

410
00:22:49,862 --> 00:22:52,363
There have to be consequences.

411
00:22:52,365 --> 00:22:54,332
We can't just let them hang people.

412
00:22:55,701 --> 00:22:57,035
No.

413
00:22:58,370 --> 00:23:00,004
Hopefully, we figure it out before Murphy

414
00:23:00,006 --> 00:23:02,240
kills us for helping her.

415
00:23:02,242 --> 00:23:04,375
He's not the forgive and forget type.

416
00:23:12,851 --> 00:23:15,119
- How did you...
- Don't worry about it.

417
00:23:15,121 --> 00:23:16,854
How fast can you install it?

418
00:23:16,856 --> 00:23:18,556
I don't know. A few hours, maybe.

419
00:23:18,558 --> 00:23:20,291
We may not have that much time.

420
00:23:21,393 --> 00:23:22,560
I'm on it.

421
00:23:25,264 --> 00:23:28,466
Our ancestors built this
ark to be our salvation,

422
00:23:28,468 --> 00:23:32,103
but it's also our test.

423
00:23:35,274 --> 00:23:38,776
But we endure because we have faith.

424
00:23:38,778 --> 00:23:42,747
Faith that one day, generations from now,

425
00:23:43,249 --> 00:23:47,752
our people will return to the ground.

426
00:23:48,154 --> 00:23:49,720
Are you here to join us?

427
00:23:49,722 --> 00:23:51,589
He's here to see me, Vera.

428
00:23:51,591 --> 00:23:53,457
Go on with your mumbo-jumbo.

429
00:24:00,899 --> 00:24:04,401
Your mother's inspired today, Marcus.

430
00:24:04,403 --> 00:24:06,570
I remember when you were
the tender of the tree.

431
00:24:06,572 --> 00:24:08,272
You were a cute kid.

432
00:24:08,274 --> 00:24:10,140
Let's begin the offering.

433
00:24:13,078 --> 00:24:15,446
Why did you bring me down
here, Nygel? What do you want?

434
00:24:15,448 --> 00:24:16,914
It's about what you want.

435
00:24:16,916 --> 00:24:18,649
I have something for you.

436
00:24:18,651 --> 00:24:20,751
Unless is a signed
confession, I'm not interested.

437
00:24:20,753 --> 00:24:23,520
Not even if it involves
your friend Abby Griffin?

438
00:24:26,791 --> 00:24:27,825
What about Abby?

439
00:24:27,827 --> 00:24:29,593
She and a girl named Raven Reyes

440
00:24:29,595 --> 00:24:32,496
asked me to get them a pressure regulator.

441
00:24:32,498 --> 00:24:34,298
As a lowly culinary tech,

442
00:24:34,300 --> 00:24:35,566
I didn't feel I had a choice

443
00:24:35,568 --> 00:24:37,334
when one of your fellow councillors

444
00:24:37,336 --> 00:24:39,703
asked me to help her break the law.

445
00:24:42,440 --> 00:24:44,808
And since when do you

446
00:24:44,810 --> 00:24:45,909
give up your customers?

447
00:24:45,911 --> 00:24:48,679
I don't have customers, Marcus.

448
00:24:48,681 --> 00:24:50,647
I am a citizen of The Ark,

449
00:24:50,649 --> 00:24:52,115
and I don't believe anyone

450
00:24:52,117 --> 00:24:54,384
should be above the law.

451
00:24:54,386 --> 00:24:55,585
Do you?

452
00:24:56,754 --> 00:24:58,889
You're a plague on this ship, Nygel.

453
00:25:01,292 --> 00:25:03,493
And even if what you said is true,

454
00:25:03,495 --> 00:25:06,096
it's your word against
a member of the council,

455
00:25:06,098 --> 00:25:07,664
and who do you think
the people will believe?

456
00:25:10,168 --> 00:25:14,070
You know... you should thank me.

457
00:25:15,172 --> 00:25:17,140
With Abby out the way,

458
00:25:17,142 --> 00:25:20,210
your agenda should sail right through.

459
00:25:22,980 --> 00:25:25,148
I don't know what you're talking about.

460
00:25:25,150 --> 00:25:27,650
You're almost as convincing as your mother.

461
00:25:27,652 --> 00:25:30,820
As the earth will one day provide for us,

462
00:25:30,822 --> 00:25:32,655
so we provide for the earth.

463
00:25:32,657 --> 00:25:34,858
Waste of water if you ask me.

464
00:25:36,026 --> 00:25:37,260
Not to them.

465
00:25:56,547 --> 00:25:59,382
Finn. Finn, wake up.

466
00:26:03,721 --> 00:26:04,887
She's gone.

467
00:26:27,991 --> 00:26:29,692
Charlotte!

468
00:26:29,694 --> 00:26:32,428
You can't hide forever.

469
00:26:32,430 --> 00:26:34,196
Don't worry. We won't hurt you.

470
00:26:38,869 --> 00:26:39,902
Let me go!

471
00:26:39,904 --> 00:26:41,771
I'm trying... hey, hey.

472
00:26:41,773 --> 00:26:43,339
I'm trying to help you.

473
00:26:43,341 --> 00:26:47,276
I'm not your sister! Just stop helping me!

474
00:26:47,278 --> 00:26:48,677
I'm over here!

475
00:26:48,679 --> 00:26:50,546
Are you trying to get us both killed?

476
00:26:50,548 --> 00:26:53,582
Just go, ok? I'm the one they want.

477
00:26:53,584 --> 00:26:56,952
Ok, Charlotte, listen to me.

478
00:26:56,954 --> 00:26:59,021
I won't leave you.

479
00:27:01,091 --> 00:27:02,725
Please, Bellamy.

480
00:27:06,697 --> 00:27:10,566
Aah! Murphy! I'm over here!

481
00:27:11,068 --> 00:27:13,802
Come on out, Charlotte! Come on out.

482
00:27:25,448 --> 00:27:27,082
Someone else was here.

483
00:27:27,084 --> 00:27:30,352
- No, no! Murphy!
- Murphy has her.

484
00:27:39,429 --> 00:27:41,597
Abby, how about I pace

485
00:27:41,599 --> 00:27:43,665
in the operating room
next time you're working?

486
00:27:46,470 --> 00:27:48,670
Abby, did you take
morphine from the clinic?

487
00:27:50,807 --> 00:27:52,507
They inventoried already?

488
00:27:52,509 --> 00:27:55,477
No. Kane was just here.
He's on his way to Mecha

489
00:27:55,479 --> 00:27:57,079
to arrest both of you right now.

490
00:27:57,081 --> 00:27:59,014
You gave Nygel morphine?

491
00:27:59,016 --> 00:28:00,415
She turned me in.

492
00:28:01,984 --> 00:28:03,084
How much longer?

493
00:28:03,086 --> 00:28:04,486
20 minutes.

494
00:28:04,488 --> 00:28:06,221
They're gonna be here in 5.

495
00:28:10,593 --> 00:28:12,861
No matter what happens,

496
00:28:12,863 --> 00:28:14,262
you launch that pod.

497
00:28:14,264 --> 00:28:16,498
Do you understand?

498
00:28:16,500 --> 00:28:17,732
I'm not going without you.

499
00:28:19,001 --> 00:28:22,137
Only one of us needs to
get to the ground, Raven.

500
00:28:22,139 --> 00:28:23,972
The second you find those kids,

501
00:28:23,974 --> 00:28:26,007
you radio back.

502
00:28:26,009 --> 00:28:28,576
300 innocent people will die if you don't.

503
00:28:32,715 --> 00:28:35,316
Abby, they'll float you.

504
00:28:41,290 --> 00:28:42,724
Then they'll float me.

505
00:29:03,645 --> 00:29:05,546
Tell Clarke I love her.

506
00:29:08,917 --> 00:29:10,585
Charlotte!

507
00:29:10,587 --> 00:29:11,919
Put me down!

508
00:29:13,188 --> 00:29:14,388
Charlotte!

509
00:29:17,259 --> 00:29:18,426
Damn it.

510
00:29:22,497 --> 00:29:23,664
Bellamy!

511
00:29:24,700 --> 00:29:26,567
You cannot fight all of us. Give her up.

512
00:29:27,669 --> 00:29:29,770
Maybe not, but I guarantee

513
00:29:29,772 --> 00:29:30,871
I'll take a few of you with me.

514
00:29:30,873 --> 00:29:32,840
Bellamy! Stop!

515
00:29:34,142 --> 00:29:35,576
This has gone too far.

516
00:29:37,245 --> 00:29:38,446
Just calm down.

517
00:29:38,448 --> 00:29:39,847
We'll talk about this.

518
00:29:45,420 --> 00:29:47,988
I'm sick of listening to you talk.

519
00:29:47,990 --> 00:29:50,724
- Let her go.
- I will slit her throat.

520
00:29:50,726 --> 00:29:53,827
No, please. Please don't hurt her.

521
00:29:53,829 --> 00:29:55,162
Don't hurt her?

522
00:29:56,364 --> 00:29:58,098
Ok, I'll make you a deal.

523
00:29:58,100 --> 00:29:59,133
You come with me right now,

524
00:29:59,135 --> 00:30:00,267
I will let her go.

525
00:30:01,903 --> 00:30:03,404
Don't do it, Charlotte.

526
00:30:05,740 --> 00:30:07,207
Don't do it, Charlotte!

527
00:30:07,209 --> 00:30:09,843
No! No, I have to!

528
00:30:12,647 --> 00:30:15,149
Murphy, this is not happening.

529
00:30:15,151 --> 00:30:18,619
I can't let any of you get hurt anymore.

530
00:30:18,621 --> 00:30:22,823
Not because of me. Not after what I did.

531
00:30:25,927 --> 00:30:27,227
Charlotte!

532
00:30:27,229 --> 00:30:28,395
No!

533
00:30:28,963 --> 00:30:32,499
No, no, no! No!

534
00:30:49,774 --> 00:30:50,975
Bellamy.

535
00:30:55,381 --> 00:30:56,513
Bellamy.

536
00:30:59,317 --> 00:31:01,885
Bellamy, stop! You'll kill him!

537
00:31:04,556 --> 00:31:05,956
Get off me! Uhh! He deserves to die.

538
00:31:08,560 --> 00:31:11,095
No! We don't decide who lives and dies.

539
00:31:11,097 --> 00:31:12,563
Not down here.

540
00:31:15,867 --> 00:31:17,668
So help me God, if you say the people

541
00:31:17,670 --> 00:31:18,769
have a right to decide...

542
00:31:18,771 --> 00:31:21,104
No, I was wrong before, ok?

543
00:31:21,106 --> 00:31:22,639
You were right.

544
00:31:22,641 --> 00:31:25,609
Sometimes it's dangerous
to tell people the truth.

545
00:31:25,611 --> 00:31:27,978
But if we're gonna survive down here,

546
00:31:27,980 --> 00:31:29,546
we can't just live by

547
00:31:29,548 --> 00:31:31,481
whatever the hell we want.

548
00:31:31,483 --> 00:31:33,083
We need rules.

549
00:31:33,085 --> 00:31:36,787
And who makes those rules, huh? You?

550
00:31:36,789 --> 00:31:39,890
For now, we make the rules. Ok?

551
00:31:39,892 --> 00:31:41,892
So, what, then? We just take him back

552
00:31:41,894 --> 00:31:43,260
and pretend like it never happened?

553
00:31:43,262 --> 00:31:44,494
No!

554
00:31:52,470 --> 00:31:53,670
We banish him.

555
00:32:01,345 --> 00:32:02,512
Get up.

556
00:32:02,914 --> 00:32:04,881
Bellamy! Stop!

557
00:32:07,351 --> 00:32:09,686
If I ever catch you near camp,

558
00:32:09,688 --> 00:32:10,987
we'll be back here.

559
00:32:12,156 --> 00:32:13,456
Understand?

560
00:32:18,629 --> 00:32:20,730
As for the four of you,

561
00:32:20,732 --> 00:32:22,966
you can come back and follow me,

562
00:32:22,968 --> 00:32:25,702
or go off with him to die.

563
00:32:25,704 --> 00:32:27,170
Your choice.

564
00:33:10,013 --> 00:33:11,480
Come on, come on!

565
00:33:26,963 --> 00:33:28,097
No!

566
00:33:29,966 --> 00:33:31,367
Damn it!

567
00:33:33,904 --> 00:33:35,538
She gave us a bad part.

568
00:33:56,793 --> 00:33:58,794
I'm hoping...

569
00:33:58,796 --> 00:34:01,830
there's a logical explanation for all this.

570
00:34:01,832 --> 00:34:03,165
My daughter.

571
00:34:05,435 --> 00:34:08,837
I know. I'm sorry.

572
00:34:10,773 --> 00:34:12,140
We all knew it was a long shot.

573
00:34:15,311 --> 00:34:16,979
I still believe.

574
00:34:25,088 --> 00:34:27,122
What's the pressure regulator for, Abby?

575
00:34:32,428 --> 00:34:34,696
There's no bacteria, is there?

576
00:34:37,166 --> 00:34:39,434
Your infected mechanic...

577
00:34:39,436 --> 00:34:40,969
Raven Reyes.

578
00:34:42,972 --> 00:34:44,306
What's she up to?

579
00:34:58,387 --> 00:35:01,456
Did you know that her
boyfriend Finn Collins...

580
00:35:02,692 --> 00:35:04,025
was one of the hundred?

581
00:35:06,629 --> 00:35:08,830
Your obsession...

582
00:35:08,832 --> 00:35:10,665
is now gonna get her floated, too.

583
00:35:19,775 --> 00:35:22,544
If you don't tell me what you're up to...

584
00:35:24,346 --> 00:35:26,014
I won't be able to save her.

585
00:35:28,183 --> 00:35:30,084
You still don't understand.

586
00:35:32,955 --> 00:35:35,390
I'm trying to save all of us.

587
00:35:41,897 --> 00:35:43,164
Arrest her.

588
00:35:44,299 --> 00:35:45,933
Continue to search for Raven Reyes.

589
00:35:45,935 --> 00:35:47,101
Sir.

590
00:36:03,452 --> 00:36:05,086
What was that?

591
00:36:05,088 --> 00:36:07,989
Sir, a pod launched.

592
00:36:09,992 --> 00:36:14,261
Abby... what have you done?

593
00:36:15,497 --> 00:36:17,031
We have to know the truth.

594
00:36:25,574 --> 00:36:29,076
That's why we've decided to banish...

595
00:36:29,078 --> 00:36:30,744
Anybody got a problem with that?

596
00:36:48,029 --> 00:36:50,030
Will we be able to talk to them?

597
00:36:50,032 --> 00:36:52,366
No. More like morse code.

598
00:36:55,703 --> 00:36:57,070
You want to do the honors?

599
00:37:03,344 --> 00:37:04,578
That port right there.

600
00:37:33,508 --> 00:37:34,808
What the hell?

601
00:37:37,678 --> 00:37:39,479
What happened?

602
00:37:39,481 --> 00:37:40,647
It didn't work.

603
00:37:42,617 --> 00:37:44,818
I think we fried all the wristbands.

604
00:38:06,807 --> 00:38:08,675
Sit there at your own risk.

605
00:38:08,677 --> 00:38:10,443
I think I might be cursed.

606
00:38:10,445 --> 00:38:12,312
Then call me a risk taker.

607
00:38:12,314 --> 00:38:14,214
And Jasper, you're not cursed.

608
00:38:15,149 --> 00:38:16,683
I'm lucky then.

609
00:38:16,685 --> 00:38:19,018
No. Brave.

610
00:38:19,020 --> 00:38:20,954
Brave?

611
00:38:20,956 --> 00:38:22,422
For getting my face bashed in

612
00:38:22,424 --> 00:38:24,857
or for ruining any
chance to contact The Ark?

613
00:38:24,859 --> 00:38:27,060
No, for standing up to a bully

614
00:38:27,062 --> 00:38:29,462
and trying to help everyone.

615
00:38:29,464 --> 00:38:32,799
Yeah. And failing. Both times.

616
00:38:32,801 --> 00:38:36,836
I didn't see anyone else step up. Did you?

617
00:38:36,838 --> 00:38:38,404
And I don't care how things turned out.

618
00:38:38,406 --> 00:38:40,540
You were brave to try.

619
00:38:40,542 --> 00:38:42,542
And bravery is always rewarded.

620
00:39:03,230 --> 00:39:04,430
Finn!

621
00:39:05,232 --> 00:39:07,266
Finn, stop it! Calm down!

622
00:39:07,268 --> 00:39:09,802
We're dead to them! Don't you get that?

623
00:39:09,804 --> 00:39:10,936
No, there's still hope.

624
00:39:10,938 --> 00:39:12,271
Even you don't believe that.

625
00:39:12,273 --> 00:39:13,839
It's over, Clarke.

626
00:39:13,841 --> 00:39:15,941
They're gonna die up
there, and we're alone.

627
00:39:20,214 --> 00:39:22,414
You're not alone.
