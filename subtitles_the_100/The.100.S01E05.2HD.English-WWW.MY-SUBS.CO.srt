1
00:00:00,567 --> 00:00:02,320
I was born in space.

2
00:00:02,752 --> 00:00:04,652
I've never felt the sun on my face

3
00:00:04,654 --> 00:00:07,989
or breathed real air
or floated in the water.

4
00:00:08,391 --> 00:00:10,891
None of us have. For 3 generations,

5
00:00:10,893 --> 00:00:14,685
The Ark has kept what's
left of the human race alive,

6
00:00:14,690 --> 00:00:17,891
but now our home is dying, and we

7
00:00:17,893 --> 00:00:19,440
are the last hope of mankind.

8
00:00:20,089 --> 00:00:23,810
100 prisoners sent on a
desperate mission to the ground.

9
00:00:23,812 --> 00:00:26,007
Each of us is here
because we broke the law.

10
00:00:26,009 --> 00:00:28,743
On the ground, there is no law.

11
00:00:28,745 --> 00:00:29,903
All we have to do is survive.

12
00:00:30,135 --> 00:00:31,349
But we will be tested,

13
00:00:31,351 --> 00:00:34,409
by the Earth, by the secrets it hides,

14
00:00:34,411 --> 00:00:37,009
and most of all, by each other.

15
00:00:38,310 --> 00:00:39,558
Previously on The 100...

16
00:00:39,567 --> 00:00:41,420
These children need more time.

17
00:00:41,422 --> 00:00:44,474
We don't have time.
Engineering needs 6 months

18
00:00:44,476 --> 00:00:48,655
to fix life support, or
we'll be out of oxygen in 4.

19
00:00:48,657 --> 00:00:50,803
No matter what happens,
you launch that pod.

20
00:00:50,805 --> 00:00:53,809
The second you find those
kids, you radio back.

21
00:00:53,811 --> 00:00:56,062
300 innocent people will die if you don't.

22
00:01:05,086 --> 00:01:07,588
Sir... a pod launched.

23
00:01:18,500 --> 00:01:20,137
Hey.

24
00:01:20,139 --> 00:01:21,442
Hi.

25
00:01:25,033 --> 00:01:26,438
It's almost dawn.

26
00:01:26,440 --> 00:01:28,242
We should probably get going.

27
00:01:28,244 --> 00:01:31,283
Can't just lie around in bed all day.

28
00:01:31,285 --> 00:01:35,002
Or we could just lie around in bed all day.

29
00:01:41,899 --> 00:01:47,412
Finn... you know that last night wasn't

30
00:01:47,414 --> 00:01:50,722
just about needing someone.

31
00:01:53,126 --> 00:01:54,394
I needed you.

32
00:01:56,102 --> 00:01:57,802
I wanted it to be you.

33
00:01:59,539 --> 00:02:00,910
You understand that, right?

34
00:02:01,781 --> 00:02:02,951
Sure.

35
00:02:05,324 --> 00:02:08,559
And I should probably tell you that

36
00:02:08,561 --> 00:02:13,539
last night, for me,
wasn't really about you.

37
00:02:16,277 --> 00:02:20,221
I just wanted to have my first Earth sex.

38
00:02:22,458 --> 00:02:26,802
You were around. Passably cute.

39
00:02:26,804 --> 00:02:28,306
Jackass.

40
00:02:41,906 --> 00:02:44,912
Prisoner. Step to the rear of the cell.

41
00:02:45,883 --> 00:02:47,285
Have we heard from Raven?

42
00:02:48,322 --> 00:02:49,755
You can leave us alone, Sergeant.

43
00:02:49,757 --> 00:02:50,923
Sir.

44
00:02:51,826 --> 00:02:53,795
Has Raven started her descent?

45
00:02:56,132 --> 00:02:57,200
Environmental numbers?

46
00:02:57,202 --> 00:02:58,268
As of this morning.

47
00:02:58,270 --> 00:03:00,106
Oxygen is down 16%.

48
00:03:00,108 --> 00:03:02,542
Co2 and methane are heading to red levels.

49
00:03:02,544 --> 00:03:04,411
Our projections said that
we wouldn't be critical

50
00:03:04,413 --> 00:03:05,814
for another 3 months.

51
00:03:05,816 --> 00:03:08,086
Your husband's projections were wrong.

52
00:03:08,088 --> 00:03:11,457
The council has granted you
work release pending review.

53
00:03:11,459 --> 00:03:12,626
Medical is overwhelmed.

54
00:03:12,628 --> 00:03:15,665
Dizziness, fatigue, vision problems.

55
00:03:15,667 --> 00:03:17,903
It's pulmonary toxicity.

56
00:03:17,905 --> 00:03:19,875
I know how they feel.

57
00:03:19,877 --> 00:03:23,949
The prison section has been
on half-air since midnight.

58
00:03:26,989 --> 00:03:28,291
No.

59
00:03:28,293 --> 00:03:30,161
I'm not gonna take more than my share.

60
00:03:30,163 --> 00:03:32,966
We start choosing who gets extra o2,

61
00:03:32,968 --> 00:03:34,603
and we're one step closer

62
00:03:34,605 --> 00:03:36,808
to choosing who lives and who dies.

63
00:03:36,810 --> 00:03:40,815
Abby... The council approved Kane's

64
00:03:40,817 --> 00:03:43,519
population reduction plan 3 hours ago.

65
00:03:43,521 --> 00:03:44,855
You voted without me.

66
00:03:44,857 --> 00:03:46,860
We followed the rules of order.

67
00:03:46,862 --> 00:03:48,329
It wouldn't have mattered.

68
00:03:48,331 --> 00:03:50,902
Their approval was unanimous.

69
00:03:50,904 --> 00:03:52,539
We start in 12 hours.

70
00:03:56,546 --> 00:03:57,781
How many?

71
00:03:57,783 --> 00:04:00,017
320 people will be excised from the grid.

72
00:04:00,019 --> 00:04:03,488
No, murdered, Thelonious.
320 people will be murdered.

73
00:04:03,490 --> 00:04:05,659
We need to wait for Raven to report back.

74
00:04:08,901 --> 00:04:10,403
Look at those numbers.

75
00:04:10,405 --> 00:04:13,073
Every hour that passes, we
put more people in danger.

76
00:04:13,075 --> 00:04:15,006
She risked her life for those people.

77
00:04:15,008 --> 00:04:17,542
No, you risked her life.

78
00:04:17,544 --> 00:04:19,077
When you let her believe that loving a boy

79
00:04:19,079 --> 00:04:20,645
somehow meant trusting her life

80
00:04:20,647 --> 00:04:23,550
in a 100-year-old metal coffin.

81
00:04:23,552 --> 00:04:26,252
And that trust is going to kill her.

82
00:04:26,254 --> 00:04:30,218
Another child dead,
just like all the others,

83
00:04:30,220 --> 00:04:31,752
just like our own.

84
00:04:36,161 --> 00:04:39,263
Take this. People are suffering.

85
00:04:39,265 --> 00:04:40,464
You can help.

86
00:04:45,674 --> 00:04:48,541
Raven will make it to
Earth. I know she will.

87
00:04:48,543 --> 00:04:49,946
Godspeed to her.

88
00:05:07,570 --> 00:05:13,275
Ok. RCS valve... open.

89
00:05:13,277 --> 00:05:17,580
RCS thrust pressure good.

90
00:05:17,582 --> 00:05:21,947
Ahh. Attitude... good.

91
00:05:21,949 --> 00:05:25,983
Heat shield... good.

92
00:05:25,985 --> 00:05:29,186
Ok. Ahh.

93
00:05:32,390 --> 00:05:33,890
Don't blow up.

94
00:05:35,758 --> 00:05:36,925
Uhh!

95
00:06:00,681 --> 00:06:02,114
It's so quiet.

96
00:06:06,254 --> 00:06:07,655
Hey, where'd you get that shirt?

97
00:06:08,825 --> 00:06:11,527
Oh. Well, there were more than just

98
00:06:11,529 --> 00:06:13,729
art supplies in the bunker, Finn.

99
00:06:16,302 --> 00:06:17,536
We should share.

100
00:06:20,774 --> 00:06:23,745
If we brought the stuff back,

101
00:06:23,747 --> 00:06:26,376
then they'd know that we found someplace

102
00:06:26,378 --> 00:06:27,810
and where would we go next time

103
00:06:27,812 --> 00:06:29,914
someone pulls a Murphy and goes ballistic?

104
00:06:31,981 --> 00:06:33,347
Yeah.

105
00:06:43,658 --> 00:06:45,425
I wanted it to be you, too.

106
00:07:09,953 --> 00:07:12,087
Finn. Look.

107
00:07:16,294 --> 00:07:17,627
A shooting star.

108
00:07:18,429 --> 00:07:19,695
You should make a wish.

109
00:07:20,531 --> 00:07:22,332
Why?

110
00:07:22,334 --> 00:07:24,268
It's a thing people used
to do a long time ago.

111
00:07:25,303 --> 00:07:26,901
I read about it.

112
00:07:26,903 --> 00:07:28,035
But it's just a rock

113
00:07:28,037 --> 00:07:29,270
burning up in the atmosphere.

114
00:07:29,272 --> 00:07:32,740
Why would that make your wish come true?

115
00:07:34,842 --> 00:07:37,574
All right... romance killer.

116
00:07:45,181 --> 00:07:47,384
Finn, that's not a shooting star.

117
00:07:49,819 --> 00:07:52,486
Check it out.

118
00:07:52,488 --> 00:07:54,556
Bellamy! Get out here!

119
00:07:57,492 --> 00:07:59,460
There!

120
00:07:59,462 --> 00:08:01,097
They're coming to help us.

121
00:08:01,099 --> 00:08:02,766
Now we can kick some grounder ass.

122
00:08:02,768 --> 00:08:04,199
- Ha ha!
- Yeah!

123
00:08:04,201 --> 00:08:06,566
Please tell me they
brought down some shampoo.

124
00:08:11,139 --> 00:08:15,845
We should stop at camp.
Get some gear. Weapons.

125
00:08:15,847 --> 00:08:17,381
They send some down?

126
00:08:17,383 --> 00:08:18,649
It's too small to be a dropship.

127
00:08:18,651 --> 00:08:19,884
I'm thinking cargo pod.

128
00:08:19,886 --> 00:08:21,319
No. They wouldn't arm

129
00:08:21,321 --> 00:08:23,120
a bunch of juvenile delinquents.

130
00:08:23,122 --> 00:08:24,821
It's probably nutrition packs,

131
00:08:24,823 --> 00:08:26,290
medical supplies.

132
00:08:26,292 --> 00:08:28,126
There'd be a radio.

133
00:08:28,128 --> 00:08:29,729
We can talk to The Ark.

134
00:08:29,731 --> 00:08:32,000
That is if the radio
wasn't fried in the landing.

135
00:08:32,002 --> 00:08:33,267
We're not alone down here anymore.

136
00:08:33,269 --> 00:08:34,634
That's a good thing.

137
00:08:34,636 --> 00:08:39,438
Yeah, not for Wells or Charlotte or Atom.

138
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:41,804
Nobody thought any of us would survive.

139
00:08:41,806 --> 00:08:43,473
But we did.

140
00:08:43,475 --> 00:08:46,009
You should take a minute
to appreciate that.

141
00:08:49,112 --> 00:08:51,048
Ok. Minute's done.

142
00:08:54,819 --> 00:08:57,554
If it cleared the ridge,
it's probably near the lake.

143
00:08:57,556 --> 00:08:59,522
We should get moving. Everyone's ready.

144
00:08:59,524 --> 00:09:01,290
No one's going anywhere.

145
00:09:01,292 --> 00:09:04,025
Not while it's dark. It isn't safe.

146
00:09:04,027 --> 00:09:06,162
We'll head out at first
light. Pass the word.

147
00:09:09,964 --> 00:09:12,964
Everyone for 100 miles
saw this thing come down.

148
00:09:12,966 --> 00:09:15,368
What if the grounders get to it first?

149
00:09:15,370 --> 00:09:17,001
Bell, we should go now.

150
00:09:17,003 --> 00:09:18,971
I said we wait until sunrise.

151
00:09:25,915 --> 00:09:31,888
Blue triangle. Orange
square. Yellow triangle.

152
00:09:33,558 --> 00:09:36,858
Green circle. A little smooshed.

153
00:09:36,860 --> 00:09:38,161
It's an oval.

154
00:09:38,163 --> 00:09:40,064
Thanks, dad. I forget,

155
00:09:40,066 --> 00:09:41,467
whose eyes are they testing?

156
00:09:41,469 --> 00:09:43,437
Ok, Reese.

157
00:09:43,439 --> 00:09:44,771
Now the other eye.

158
00:09:46,573 --> 00:09:48,338
Nothing. It's just black.

159
00:09:49,806 --> 00:09:53,274
Ok. Let me know if you see

160
00:09:53,276 --> 00:09:54,543
anything at all.

161
00:09:56,080 --> 00:09:57,346
Are you doing it?

162
00:09:58,882 --> 00:10:00,416
We're finished.

163
00:10:00,418 --> 00:10:03,053
Why don't you wait outside
while I talk to your dad?

164
00:10:03,055 --> 00:10:04,722
Wait with Miss Lucy.

165
00:10:04,724 --> 00:10:05,789
Hey, wait.

166
00:10:05,791 --> 00:10:06,822
It's fine.

167
00:10:06,824 --> 00:10:07,956
Let me get this out of your eyes.

168
00:10:07,958 --> 00:10:09,625
I don't know how you can see.

169
00:10:09,627 --> 00:10:12,762
I can't see. That's why we're here. Duh.

170
00:10:15,129 --> 00:10:16,630
Don't worry... the rolling of the eyes

171
00:10:16,632 --> 00:10:18,398
and the attitude doesn't last for long.

172
00:10:18,400 --> 00:10:20,099
10, 15 years, maybe.

173
00:10:20,101 --> 00:10:22,938
It's just an act. She's scared.

174
00:10:22,940 --> 00:10:24,207
It's not getting any better.

175
00:10:24,209 --> 00:10:25,743
The decline has been accelerating

176
00:10:25,745 --> 00:10:26,878
for the past few days.

177
00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:28,445
The air's never been this bad.

178
00:10:28,447 --> 00:10:29,780
They're gonna fix it, right?

179
00:10:29,782 --> 00:10:30,948
Like always?

180
00:10:31,883 --> 00:10:33,084
I hope so.

181
00:10:35,688 --> 00:10:38,958
Hey. She's a 9-year-old girl.

182
00:10:38,960 --> 00:10:40,260
What's she gonna do
with the rest of her life

183
00:10:40,262 --> 00:10:41,294
blind in this place?

184
00:10:41,296 --> 00:10:42,428
She's strong.

185
00:10:43,262 --> 00:10:44,663
She shouldn't have to be.

186
00:10:49,802 --> 00:10:51,869
Hey. You all right?

187
00:10:51,871 --> 00:10:54,076
I just saw a little girl
with optic nerve damage

188
00:10:54,078 --> 00:10:57,311
because of chronic oxygen deficiency.

189
00:10:57,313 --> 00:11:00,314
She's going blind and I
can't do anything about it,

190
00:11:00,316 --> 00:11:02,617
so, no, nothing about any of this is right.

191
00:11:03,785 --> 00:11:05,551
You're doing what you can.

192
00:11:05,553 --> 00:11:08,321
Why aren't you monitoring the radio?

193
00:11:08,323 --> 00:11:09,689
Listening for Raven?

194
00:11:09,691 --> 00:11:12,323
Have you looked outside? We're slammed.

195
00:11:12,325 --> 00:11:14,458
It's still transmitting the automatic hail.

196
00:11:14,460 --> 00:11:15,660
I'll take care of medical

197
00:11:15,662 --> 00:11:17,496
and you listen to that radio.

198
00:11:17,498 --> 00:11:18,927
Making contact with the ground

199
00:11:18,929 --> 00:11:21,030
is the only way we can
really help these people.

200
00:11:25,236 --> 00:11:29,074
Pod one, pod one, this
is Ark Station Medical.

201
00:11:29,076 --> 00:11:31,243
If you are receiving, please respond.

202
00:11:31,245 --> 00:11:35,349
Pod one, pod one, this
is Ark Station Medical.

203
00:11:35,351 --> 00:11:37,685
If you are receiving, please respond.

204
00:11:37,687 --> 00:11:41,223
One, pod one, this is Ark Station Medical.

205
00:11:41,225 --> 00:11:42,391
If you are receiving...

206
00:11:45,185 --> 00:11:46,788
Looks like everybody's up.

207
00:11:50,531 --> 00:11:52,096
Did you guys see that?

208
00:11:52,098 --> 00:11:53,764
You know it's from the
ark, right? It had to be.

209
00:11:53,766 --> 00:11:55,632
Grab your stuff. Let's find out.

210
00:11:55,634 --> 00:11:57,334
Bellamy said we're
gonna wait until sunrise.

211
00:11:57,336 --> 00:11:58,569
Where is he?

212
00:12:02,809 --> 00:12:04,979
Ever hear of knocking, bitch?

213
00:12:04,981 --> 00:12:06,114
Oh, great, it's a free show.

214
00:12:06,116 --> 00:12:07,449
Anyone else want to take a look?

215
00:12:07,451 --> 00:12:08,816
Where the hell is Bellamy?

216
00:12:08,818 --> 00:12:10,217
He took off a while ago.

217
00:12:10,219 --> 00:12:11,319
Gear's gone.

218
00:12:11,321 --> 00:12:12,990
He told everyone to stay.

219
00:12:12,992 --> 00:12:14,826
Whatever's in that thing, he wants it.

220
00:12:14,828 --> 00:12:16,292
We've gotta get there before he does.

221
00:12:18,028 --> 00:12:19,295
You're welcome.

222
00:12:21,434 --> 00:12:23,003
This isn't your fault, Clarke.

223
00:12:23,005 --> 00:12:25,172
I should've known he'd go for that radio.

224
00:12:25,174 --> 00:12:26,909
How are you supposed to
know something like that?

225
00:12:26,911 --> 00:12:29,379
Because he's spent every
single minute since we landed

226
00:12:29,381 --> 00:12:30,712
making sure no one

227
00:12:30,714 --> 00:12:33,282
on The Ark finds out we're alive.

228
00:12:33,284 --> 00:12:34,251
It doesn't mean you can predict

229
00:12:34,253 --> 00:12:35,554
what people are gonna do.

230
00:12:35,556 --> 00:12:37,323
That's exactly what I have to do.

231
00:12:37,325 --> 00:12:38,758
I screwed up.

232
00:12:38,760 --> 00:12:40,460
Let myself get distracted.

233
00:12:45,499 --> 00:12:46,699
Bellamy!

234
00:12:47,468 --> 00:12:48,668
What are you doing?

235
00:12:48,670 --> 00:12:50,336
Go back to camp. It isn't safe.

236
00:12:50,338 --> 00:12:53,572
You lied to everyone. You lied to me.

237
00:12:53,574 --> 00:12:54,874
You just want whatever's in that pod...

238
00:12:54,876 --> 00:12:56,208
Just go home!

239
00:12:56,210 --> 00:12:58,908
You always want to play
the big brother, huh?

240
00:12:58,910 --> 00:13:01,342
Well, guess what? Joke's on me.

241
00:13:01,344 --> 00:13:03,109
You're just a selfish dick.

242
00:13:03,111 --> 00:13:07,447
I did this for you, to protect you.

243
00:13:07,449 --> 00:13:10,250
If The Ark finds out we're
alive, they'll come down.

244
00:13:10,252 --> 00:13:11,585
And when they do...

245
00:13:13,455 --> 00:13:14,755
I'm dead.

246
00:13:14,757 --> 00:13:15,989
What did you do?

247
00:13:16,758 --> 00:13:18,027
I shot him.

248
00:13:19,830 --> 00:13:21,097
I shot Jaha.

249
00:13:21,099 --> 00:13:22,633
What?

250
00:13:22,635 --> 00:13:25,305
I found out they were sending you to Earth.

251
00:13:25,307 --> 00:13:27,041
I couldn't let you go alone.

252
00:13:28,175 --> 00:13:30,908
Someone came to me with a deal...

253
00:13:30,910 --> 00:13:32,944
do this. Kill him,

254
00:13:32,946 --> 00:13:34,713
and they'd get me on the dropship.

255
00:13:36,883 --> 00:13:38,550
And I did it.

256
00:13:38,552 --> 00:13:40,086
You killed the chancellor?

257
00:13:40,088 --> 00:13:42,422
He floated our mother.

258
00:13:42,424 --> 00:13:44,526
He locked you up.

259
00:13:44,528 --> 00:13:45,927
He deserved it.

260
00:13:45,929 --> 00:13:47,628
I didn't ask you to do that.

261
00:13:50,396 --> 00:13:51,530
You're right.

262
00:13:52,365 --> 00:13:55,933
I made the choice. This is on me.

263
00:13:55,935 --> 00:13:57,870
Whatever they sent down,
I'll take care of it.

264
00:14:00,142 --> 00:14:01,876
I didn't ask for any of this.

265
00:14:10,046 --> 00:14:12,548
At 1930 hours,

266
00:14:12,550 --> 00:14:13,749
all hatches and vents

267
00:14:13,751 --> 00:14:16,886
leading to section 17 will be sealed.

268
00:14:18,390 --> 00:14:20,524
It will appear to be a malfunction

269
00:14:20,526 --> 00:14:22,025
of the fire containment system.

270
00:14:22,027 --> 00:14:24,159
So, it'll look like an accident.

271
00:14:24,161 --> 00:14:27,228
It's essential to maintaining public order

272
00:14:27,230 --> 00:14:29,232
after the culling takes place.

273
00:14:29,234 --> 00:14:30,903
All residents of Section 17

274
00:14:30,905 --> 00:14:32,538
will be in their sleep period.

275
00:14:32,540 --> 00:14:34,708
The council has already
issued a writ of consent

276
00:14:34,710 --> 00:14:37,480
giving the chancellor
permission to carry out

277
00:14:37,482 --> 00:14:39,247
the population reduction.

278
00:14:39,249 --> 00:14:41,149
A sleep-inducing gas will be

279
00:14:41,151 --> 00:14:43,486
introduced into the air.

280
00:14:43,488 --> 00:14:45,922
On your command, the oxygen supply

281
00:14:45,924 --> 00:14:48,523
to Section 17 will be cut off.

282
00:14:49,326 --> 00:14:51,163
It should be painless.

283
00:14:51,165 --> 00:14:52,833
Document needs your approval.

284
00:14:58,971 --> 00:15:00,204
You have it...

285
00:15:01,040 --> 00:15:02,507
with one alteration.

286
00:15:04,377 --> 00:15:06,510
You'll give the order
to cut off the oxygen.

287
00:15:09,349 --> 00:15:11,584
I don't have the authority.

288
00:15:11,586 --> 00:15:14,251
In your capacity as chancellor.

289
00:15:14,253 --> 00:15:17,823
Tonight, I will be in Section 17

290
00:15:17,825 --> 00:15:20,725
inspecting repairs to the hull,

291
00:15:20,727 --> 00:15:24,130
and when those doors are
closed on those people,

292
00:15:24,132 --> 00:15:27,200
their fate will be my fate.

293
00:15:27,202 --> 00:15:28,502
Your fate.

294
00:15:32,945 --> 00:15:34,213
Don't do this.

295
00:15:34,215 --> 00:15:35,882
My mind is made up.

296
00:15:35,884 --> 00:15:39,186
I'm leaving you in terrible times, Marcus,

297
00:15:39,188 --> 00:15:42,957
but you... you have a strength

298
00:15:42,959 --> 00:15:45,258
that is not weakened by sentiment.

299
00:15:47,258 --> 00:15:49,058
And that's exactly what it's going to

300
00:15:49,060 --> 00:15:51,028
take for us to survive.

301
00:15:56,869 --> 00:16:00,670
Pod one, pod one, this
is Ark Station Medical.

302
00:16:00,672 --> 00:16:03,040

303

Pod one, pod one, this

Pod one, pod one, this

306
00:16:12,987 --> 00:16:15,123
If you are receiving, please respond.

307
00:16:36,947 --> 00:16:38,715
Should we split up?

308
00:16:38,717 --> 00:16:41,118
- Yeah. You go that way.
- Ok.

309
00:16:41,120 --> 00:16:42,917
- I'll check the bottom.
- Ok.

310
00:17:03,833 --> 00:17:05,001
Ahh.

311
00:17:10,173 --> 00:17:13,676
Crap. That's not good.

312
00:17:16,910 --> 00:17:18,578
Oh, my God.

313
00:17:18,580 --> 00:17:19,747
Hi.

314
00:17:21,749 --> 00:17:22,983
I made it?

315
00:17:29,856 --> 00:17:31,123
Ha!

316
00:17:32,725 --> 00:17:36,195
Ahh. I dreamed it would smell like this.

317
00:17:38,965 --> 00:17:40,431
Is this rain?

318
00:17:42,198 --> 00:17:43,464
Welcome home.

319
00:17:50,440 --> 00:17:51,606
Raven!

320
00:17:54,178 --> 00:17:55,378
Finn!

321
00:18:03,986 --> 00:18:05,554
I knew you couldn't be dead.

322
00:18:08,756 --> 00:18:09,821
You're bleeding.

323
00:18:09,823 --> 00:18:10,955
I don't care.

324
00:18:27,691 --> 00:18:28,959
Ha ha!

325
00:18:30,329 --> 00:18:32,331
How did you get here?

326
00:18:32,333 --> 00:18:34,134
You know that big scrap hold,

327
00:18:34,136 --> 00:18:35,468
the one on K deck?

328
00:18:36,571 --> 00:18:38,338
You built that from scrap?

329
00:18:38,340 --> 00:18:40,442
I kind of rebuilt it.

330
00:18:40,444 --> 00:18:42,412
Please. Like that's hard.

331
00:18:42,414 --> 00:18:44,549
It just needed a couple
parts and some love.

332
00:18:46,151 --> 00:18:47,285
You're insane.

333
00:18:47,287 --> 00:18:50,056
I'd do more for you and worse.

334
00:18:50,058 --> 00:18:51,791
Just like you would for me.

335
00:18:57,268 --> 00:19:00,003
Come on, sit down. Sit down here.

336
00:19:05,646 --> 00:19:07,081
Let me get something for that.

337
00:19:11,353 --> 00:19:12,354
I'm sorry.

338
00:19:12,356 --> 00:19:13,890
Let's not talk about this.

339
00:19:13,892 --> 00:19:15,024
We've known each other our whole lives.

340
00:19:15,026 --> 00:19:16,291
We don't need to talk about it.

341
00:19:16,293 --> 00:19:17,958
She needs to put pressure on her wound.

342
00:19:18,994 --> 00:19:20,530
Thanks.

343
00:19:20,532 --> 00:19:22,798
This is Clarke. She was
on the dropship, too.

344
00:19:23,801 --> 00:19:25,002
Clarke?

345
00:19:26,639 --> 00:19:28,640
This was all because of your mom.

346
00:19:28,642 --> 00:19:29,775
My mom?

347
00:19:29,777 --> 00:19:31,611
This was all her plan.

348
00:19:31,613 --> 00:19:33,583
We were trying to come down here together.

349
00:19:33,585 --> 00:19:36,319
If we waited... oh, my God.

350
00:19:36,321 --> 00:19:38,619
We couldn't wait because
the council was voting

351
00:19:38,621 --> 00:19:41,422
whether to kill 300 people to save air.

352
00:19:41,424 --> 00:19:43,689
- When?
- Today.

353
00:19:43,691 --> 00:19:45,825
We have to tell them you're alive.

354
00:19:49,268 --> 00:19:50,835
The radio's gone.

355
00:19:53,008 --> 00:19:54,877
It must've gotten loose during reentry.

356
00:19:54,879 --> 00:19:57,547
I should've strapped it
to the A-strut. Stupid!

357
00:19:57,549 --> 00:19:59,384
No, no, this is my fault.

358
00:19:59,386 --> 00:20:01,289
Someone got here before us.

359
00:20:01,291 --> 00:20:02,557
We have to find him.

360
00:20:18,303 --> 00:20:20,339
Tell me it's not true.

361
00:20:20,341 --> 00:20:23,041
Today there are so many things

362
00:20:23,043 --> 00:20:25,041
that I wish weren't true.

363
00:20:25,043 --> 00:20:26,743
Spare me the noble speech.

364
00:20:26,745 --> 00:20:28,512
You know what I'm talking about.

365
00:20:28,514 --> 00:20:30,616
You joining Section 17.

366
00:20:30,618 --> 00:20:32,218
How could I ask anyone

367
00:20:32,220 --> 00:20:33,552
to make a sacrifice that I'm not

368
00:20:33,554 --> 00:20:35,755
willing to make myself?

369
00:20:35,757 --> 00:20:37,224
So, you're gonna die peacefully

370
00:20:37,226 --> 00:20:39,227
and leave humanity in the hands of Kane?

371
00:20:39,229 --> 00:20:40,963
Chancellor Kane?

372
00:20:40,965 --> 00:20:43,699
Yes. He won't hesitate to
do what needs to be done.

373
00:20:43,701 --> 00:20:47,102
Thelonious, this is all happening too fast.

374
00:20:47,104 --> 00:20:48,636
We've waited as long as possible.

375
00:20:48,638 --> 00:20:50,871
There are things that
we can do to buy us time.

376
00:20:50,873 --> 00:20:52,373
We should reconsider

377
00:20:52,375 --> 00:20:53,507
forcing an algae bloom

378
00:20:53,509 --> 00:20:55,210
to boost oxygen production.

379
00:20:55,212 --> 00:20:56,445
You've read the studies. They would only

380
00:20:56,447 --> 00:20:57,880
contaminate the water supply.

381
00:20:57,882 --> 00:20:59,346
We can induce people into comas

382
00:20:59,348 --> 00:21:01,414
to reduce their resource consumption.

383
00:21:01,416 --> 00:21:03,284
We've gone through all the possibilities.

384
00:21:03,286 --> 00:21:04,753
This is the only solution.

385
00:21:04,755 --> 00:21:06,653
No, it can't be this.

386
00:21:11,192 --> 00:21:13,629
I am doing what is right.

387
00:21:13,631 --> 00:21:15,462
You're running away.

388
00:21:15,464 --> 00:21:18,133
You think what you're doing is right

389
00:21:18,135 --> 00:21:19,469
but you're a coward.

390
00:21:25,808 --> 00:21:27,745
How are you gonna explain it to Wells?

391
00:21:27,747 --> 00:21:29,979
How would you tell your son

392
00:21:29,981 --> 00:21:31,614
that you let these people die

393
00:21:31,616 --> 00:21:33,783
without doing absolutely everything

394
00:21:33,785 --> 00:21:35,687
in your power to save them?

395
00:22:13,441 --> 00:22:17,640
People of the Ark. My name is Jake Griffin.

396
00:22:17,642 --> 00:22:19,578
I'm senior environmental engineer

397
00:22:19,580 --> 00:22:22,046
and deputy resource officer.

398
00:22:22,048 --> 00:22:25,681
Today, I need to talk
to you about our future.

399
00:22:25,683 --> 00:22:26,883
Ok.

400
00:23:10,193 --> 00:23:11,360
Hey!

401
00:23:13,895 --> 00:23:15,295
Where is it?

402
00:23:15,297 --> 00:23:18,433
Hey, princess. You taking
a walk in the woods?

403
00:23:18,435 --> 00:23:19,400
They're getting ready to kill

404
00:23:19,402 --> 00:23:21,035
300 people up there

405
00:23:21,037 --> 00:23:22,703
to save oxygen.

406
00:23:22,705 --> 00:23:23,904
And I can guarantee you

407
00:23:23,906 --> 00:23:25,240
it won't be council members.

408
00:23:25,242 --> 00:23:27,706
It'll be working people. Your people.

409
00:23:27,708 --> 00:23:29,505
Bellamy. Where's the radio?

410
00:23:29,507 --> 00:23:31,240
I have no idea what you're talking about.

411
00:23:31,242 --> 00:23:34,044
Bellamy Blake? They're
looking everywhere for you.

412
00:23:34,046 --> 00:23:35,676
Shut up.

413
00:23:35,678 --> 00:23:37,010
Looking for him why?

414
00:23:37,012 --> 00:23:38,445
He shot Chancellor Jaha.

415
00:23:40,282 --> 00:23:42,347
That's why you took the wristbands.

416
00:23:42,349 --> 00:23:44,314
Needed everyone to think we're dead.

417
00:23:44,316 --> 00:23:46,352
And all that "whatever the hell we want"?

418
00:23:46,354 --> 00:23:48,021
You just care about saving your own skin.

419
00:23:49,191 --> 00:23:52,055
Hey! Shooter! Where's my radio?

420
00:23:52,057 --> 00:23:53,821
- Get out of my way.
- Where is it?

421
00:23:53,823 --> 00:23:55,957
I should've killed you
when I had the chance.

422
00:23:55,959 --> 00:23:59,194
Really? Well, I'm right here.

423
00:24:02,397 --> 00:24:03,898
Where's my radio?

424
00:24:03,900 --> 00:24:05,233
Ok, stop it.

425
00:24:09,403 --> 00:24:11,804
Jaha deserved to die. You all know that.

426
00:24:11,806 --> 00:24:14,844
Yeah, he's not my favorite person, either.

427
00:24:14,846 --> 00:24:16,113
But he isn't dead.

428
00:24:17,983 --> 00:24:19,149
What?

429
00:24:19,984 --> 00:24:22,351
You're a lousy shot.

430
00:24:22,353 --> 00:24:25,357
Bellamy, don't you see what this means?

431
00:24:25,359 --> 00:24:27,357
You're not a murderer.

432
00:24:27,359 --> 00:24:28,693
You always did what you had to do

433
00:24:28,695 --> 00:24:29,794
to protect your sister.

434
00:24:29,796 --> 00:24:31,662
That's who you are.

435
00:24:31,664 --> 00:24:33,262
And you can do it again,

436
00:24:33,264 --> 00:24:35,964
by protecting 300 of your people.

437
00:24:37,033 --> 00:24:38,399
Where's the radio?

438
00:24:39,967 --> 00:24:41,300
It's too late.

439
00:24:45,705 --> 00:24:48,140
People of The Ark,

440
00:24:48,142 --> 00:24:51,176
today I need to talk
to you about our future.

441
00:24:52,811 --> 00:24:55,745
The things I need to tell you are serious.

442
00:24:55,747 --> 00:24:58,082
Sir, have you been on the network?

443
00:24:58,084 --> 00:25:00,286
No.

444
00:25:00,288 --> 00:25:04,488
The Ark is dying. This city in space

445
00:25:04,490 --> 00:25:06,625
that has been our sanctuary.

446
00:25:06,627 --> 00:25:07,661
It's playing everywhere.

447
00:25:07,663 --> 00:25:08,962
Tech's trying to shut it down.

448
00:25:08,964 --> 00:25:10,996
We should never have
let her out of the cell.

449
00:25:10,998 --> 00:25:14,434
Time is running out.

450
00:25:14,436 --> 00:25:20,575
This is an undeniable reality,
but we have pledged our lives

451
00:25:20,577 --> 00:25:25,277
to make sure that humanity
does not share that fate.

452
00:25:25,279 --> 00:25:29,342
Now, while there is still time,

453
00:25:29,344 --> 00:25:31,811
we must come together

454
00:25:31,813 --> 00:25:35,648
and face this crisis head on.

455
00:25:35,650 --> 00:25:39,419
I believe it will bring
out the best in us...

456
00:25:39,421 --> 00:25:44,792
our strength, our humanity, our faith...

457
00:25:44,794 --> 00:25:48,862
that we will come together
in this time of uncertainty.

458
00:25:48,864 --> 00:25:51,530
My husband was killed
for trying to warn us.

459
00:25:53,199 --> 00:25:56,268
In 12 hours, 320 people will be sacrificed

460
00:25:56,270 --> 00:25:59,204
to extend our oxygen supply
unless we take action.

461
00:26:00,777 --> 00:26:03,277
Dr. Abigail Griffin, open
this door immediately.

462
00:26:03,279 --> 00:26:06,180
The future doesn't belong to
the chancellor or the council.

463
00:26:06,182 --> 00:26:08,084
It belongs to all of us.

464
00:26:22,600 --> 00:26:24,100
I should've told you about her.

465
00:26:24,102 --> 00:26:25,334
It's ok.

466
00:26:26,604 --> 00:26:28,571
I didn't think I'd see her again.

467
00:26:28,573 --> 00:26:31,409
But you wouldn't take off your wristband.

468
00:26:31,411 --> 00:26:33,678
You had hope. It's ok, I get it/

469
00:26:34,613 --> 00:26:37,148
I was around, passably cute,

470
00:26:37,150 --> 00:26:38,617
and now it's over.

471
00:26:39,852 --> 00:26:41,551
Hey. I found it.

472
00:26:56,430 --> 00:26:57,628
Can you fix it?

473
00:26:57,630 --> 00:26:59,363
Maybe. But it'll take half a day

474
00:26:59,365 --> 00:27:00,465
just to dry out the components

475
00:27:00,467 --> 00:27:01,566
to see what's broken.

476
00:27:01,568 --> 00:27:04,534
Like I said, it's too late.

477
00:27:04,536 --> 00:27:06,935
Do you have any idea what you did?

478
00:27:06,937 --> 00:27:08,003
Do you even care?

479
00:27:08,005 --> 00:27:10,606
You asked me to help. I helped.

480
00:27:10,608 --> 00:27:13,909
300 people are gonna
die today because of you.

481
00:27:13,911 --> 00:27:17,180
Hold up. We don't have to talk to The Ark.

482
00:27:17,182 --> 00:27:18,448
We just have to let them know

483
00:27:18,450 --> 00:27:19,683
we're down here, right?

484
00:27:19,685 --> 00:27:22,419
Yeah, but how do we do that with no radio?

485
00:27:26,256 --> 00:27:28,058
You've taken an impossible situation

486
00:27:28,060 --> 00:27:29,127
and made it worse.

487
00:27:29,129 --> 00:27:30,196
This will cause a riot.

488
00:27:30,198 --> 00:27:32,031
Good. Maybe we need one.

489
00:27:32,033 --> 00:27:34,834
Guards are double-strengthen
and on alert station-wide.

490
00:27:34,836 --> 00:27:36,737
I've posted riot teams in all public areas.

491
00:27:36,739 --> 00:27:38,039
Any reports of unrest?

492
00:27:38,041 --> 00:27:40,106
Not yet, but people are gathering.

493
00:27:40,108 --> 00:27:42,511
There's a crowd of 400
strong right outside.

494
00:27:42,513 --> 00:27:43,780
That's what you've done.

495
00:27:43,782 --> 00:27:45,546
All we can do now is
determine our best option.

496
00:27:45,548 --> 00:27:48,014
Options? We have no options.

497
00:27:48,016 --> 00:27:49,384
We need time,

498
00:27:49,386 --> 00:27:51,653
or everyone on this
station is going to die.

499
00:27:51,655 --> 00:27:53,454
Either in an uprising or by suffocation.

500
00:27:53,456 --> 00:27:54,955
Those are the options she's given us.

501
00:27:54,957 --> 00:27:58,857
Sir. They sent an emissary
to speak with Abby.

502
00:27:58,859 --> 00:28:00,125
All right.

503
00:28:02,460 --> 00:28:05,293
The people outside are
sending someone in to talk.

504
00:28:06,928 --> 00:28:08,095
To you.

505
00:28:11,836 --> 00:28:13,433
His daughter's a patient of mine.

506
00:28:17,802 --> 00:28:21,673
Hey, doc. I saw your video thing.

507
00:28:21,675 --> 00:28:23,040
Crap news, it sounds like.

508
00:28:23,042 --> 00:28:25,074
I'm sorry you had to hear it like that.

509
00:28:25,076 --> 00:28:28,311
No good way to hear it, right?

510
00:28:28,313 --> 00:28:32,452
Anyway... I'm here to
volunteer, I guess you'd call it.

511
00:28:34,122 --> 00:28:37,657
Volunteer? For what?

512
00:28:37,659 --> 00:28:39,226
Section 17, sir.

513
00:28:41,264 --> 00:28:42,465
Any way you do the math,

514
00:28:42,467 --> 00:28:44,067
some of us are gonna have to jump ship

515
00:28:44,069 --> 00:28:45,403
if everyone's gonna make it, so...

516
00:28:46,705 --> 00:28:48,340
I'm gonna jump.

517
00:28:48,342 --> 00:28:50,276
You'd leave Reese without a father?

518
00:28:50,278 --> 00:28:52,878
This morning, you told me
my daughter was going blind

519
00:28:52,880 --> 00:28:55,580
and there was nothing
I could do to help her.

520
00:28:55,582 --> 00:28:56,981
Turns out there is.

521
00:28:58,583 --> 00:28:59,750
Count me in.

522
00:29:04,759 --> 00:29:07,695
Chancellor, sir, I'll take a spot in 17.

523
00:29:09,331 --> 00:29:11,232
Give my wife a little extra air.

524
00:29:22,780 --> 00:29:24,014
Jake was right.

525
00:29:24,915 --> 00:29:26,916
It would bring out the best in us.

526
00:29:41,861 --> 00:29:43,229
We need to launch those flares ASAP

527
00:29:43,231 --> 00:29:45,299
if we have any hope of saving those people.

528
00:29:45,301 --> 00:29:47,467
Finn, get that control panel to camp.

529
00:29:47,469 --> 00:29:49,337
You, pull out those firing circuits

530
00:29:49,339 --> 00:29:51,207
in one piece or they won't work.

531
00:29:51,209 --> 00:29:53,443
Clarke, can I have a hand?

532
00:29:55,312 --> 00:29:57,577
Work these bolts here gently.

533
00:29:57,579 --> 00:29:59,545
Rocket fuel likes to go boom.

534
00:30:03,182 --> 00:30:05,881
We're going to need power to fire.

535
00:30:05,883 --> 00:30:08,115
They're tying in the
batteries on the dropship.

536
00:30:08,117 --> 00:30:09,715
Should be ready when we get there.

537
00:30:09,717 --> 00:30:11,951
Great. So, what's the problem?

538
00:30:11,953 --> 00:30:14,187
Nothing. I just...

539
00:30:16,122 --> 00:30:18,323
Well, if we get the rockets to launch,

540
00:30:18,325 --> 00:30:19,623
will they see them from The Ark?

541
00:30:19,625 --> 00:30:21,092
Like the good book says,

542
00:30:21,094 --> 00:30:22,962
it's all about burn time and cloud cover.

543
00:30:24,363 --> 00:30:27,066
But I know your mom will be watching.

544
00:30:27,068 --> 00:30:29,803
I've never seen anyone love
someone the way she loves you.

545
00:30:30,871 --> 00:30:32,940
You know that, right?

546
00:30:32,942 --> 00:30:34,275
I did.

547
00:30:36,346 --> 00:30:37,612
It's complicated.

548
00:30:46,691 --> 00:30:48,727
Here's the final list of volunteers.

549
00:30:50,564 --> 00:30:52,601
They'll report to B deck
in less than an hour.

550
00:30:55,572 --> 00:30:57,239
This is more than enough.

551
00:30:58,542 --> 00:31:00,575
We rejected almost 100.

552
00:31:00,577 --> 00:31:03,245
Essential personnel and minors.

553
00:31:03,247 --> 00:31:06,518
Abby's announcement proved to be

554
00:31:06,520 --> 00:31:07,786
very convincing.

555
00:31:07,788 --> 00:31:10,658
I don't think that she or
her husband convinced anyone.

556
00:31:10,660 --> 00:31:13,896
They spoke to something that
was already inside of them.

557
00:31:13,898 --> 00:31:16,767
The new chancellor should remember that.

558
00:31:20,638 --> 00:31:22,606
I better get to 17.

559
00:31:22,608 --> 00:31:24,042
Don't want to be late for my own funeral.

560
00:31:24,044 --> 00:31:25,878
Sir.

561
00:31:25,880 --> 00:31:27,346
You don't need to do this now.

562
00:31:27,348 --> 00:31:30,548
I know what I'm doing
is right for my people.

563
00:31:30,550 --> 00:31:31,850
They've inspired me.

564
00:31:31,852 --> 00:31:34,119
No, they volunteered
because you inspired them.

565
00:31:34,121 --> 00:31:36,153
Jake Griffin inspired them

566
00:31:36,155 --> 00:31:38,723
and I executed him.

567
00:31:40,359 --> 00:31:42,727
I executed my friend.

568
00:31:42,729 --> 00:31:45,565
One decision does not define a man.

569
00:31:45,567 --> 00:31:48,936
Jake Griffin is gone. You're here.

570
00:31:48,938 --> 00:31:52,272
Our survival depends on having a leader

571
00:31:52,274 --> 00:31:54,640
who can inspire people to self-sacrifice.

572
00:31:55,876 --> 00:31:57,243
You're that man.

573
00:31:58,979 --> 00:32:00,146
Not me.

574
00:32:06,318 --> 00:32:08,820
Why do you have to work the double shift?

575
00:32:08,822 --> 00:32:10,188
It's not fair.

576
00:32:10,190 --> 00:32:13,390
Sorry. Things need to get done.

577
00:32:13,392 --> 00:32:15,629
You be good for Miss Lucy.

578
00:32:15,631 --> 00:32:18,099
Thanks, because I was
gonna totally be terrible

579
00:32:18,101 --> 00:32:19,669
if you didn't remind me.

580
00:32:19,671 --> 00:32:21,606
- Come here.
- Stop it.

581
00:32:21,608 --> 00:32:23,008
I can't even see your face.

582
00:32:23,010 --> 00:32:24,775
Seriously.

583
00:32:24,777 --> 00:32:25,942
Ok.

584
00:32:27,177 --> 00:32:28,510
Just give me a kiss.

585
00:32:30,913 --> 00:32:32,080
Hey.

586
00:32:37,957 --> 00:32:39,057
I love you.

587
00:32:39,059 --> 00:32:40,225
I love you, too.

588
00:32:56,251 --> 00:33:00,288
All nonessential personnel,
please vacate Section 17.

589
00:33:00,290 --> 00:33:01,623
Have we heard from Raven?

590
00:33:03,726 --> 00:33:05,460
Move it, move it, move it!

591
00:33:08,596 --> 00:33:10,695
You must vacate Section 17...

592
00:33:10,697 --> 00:33:12,262
What changed his mind?

593
00:33:13,799 --> 00:33:15,000
Just the truth.

594
00:33:17,170 --> 00:33:19,070
I reminded him that

595
00:33:19,072 --> 00:33:20,972
transitioning to a new chancellor

596
00:33:20,974 --> 00:33:24,175
would be... destabilizing.

597
00:33:25,843 --> 00:33:27,976
We can't afford any more upheaval.

598
00:33:27,978 --> 00:33:29,579
No, we can't.

599
00:33:33,848 --> 00:33:35,181
I left two men.

600
00:33:37,052 --> 00:33:38,520
Monitoring the radio.

601
00:33:39,989 --> 00:33:41,188
If there's any word from Raven,

602
00:33:41,190 --> 00:33:42,621
they'll call down immediately.

603
00:33:46,092 --> 00:33:47,660
I gave clear orders.

604
00:33:48,628 --> 00:33:49,827
Thank you.

605
00:34:00,845 --> 00:34:04,283
Mr. Lemkin, I want to thank
you for your sacrifice.

606
00:34:04,285 --> 00:34:07,617
Don't. This is for my daughter.

607
00:34:07,619 --> 00:34:08,852
You just think about doing right

608
00:34:08,854 --> 00:34:10,653
for the people that are left behind.

609
00:34:20,298 --> 00:34:21,464
Here you go.

610
00:35:10,346 --> 00:35:11,848
Sir, all vents and hatchways

611
00:35:11,850 --> 00:35:14,351
to Section 17 are closed.

612
00:35:14,353 --> 00:35:15,686
We have a hard seal.

613
00:35:20,760 --> 00:35:22,060
Sir?

614
00:35:27,369 --> 00:35:28,570
The order?

615
00:36:23,460 --> 00:36:28,431
And we hereby commit
these souls to the deep...

616
00:36:28,433 --> 00:36:33,102
Who at their last gave all
to the world of the living.

617
00:36:33,104 --> 00:36:35,537
May they be remembered forever,

618
00:36:35,539 --> 00:36:40,480
until there is no more
pain, no more suffering,

619
00:36:40,482 --> 00:36:46,286
and the abyss itself shall give up her dead

620
00:36:46,288 --> 00:36:48,155
and return them to us.

621
00:38:10,985 --> 00:38:12,620
You think they can see it from up there?

622
00:38:12,622 --> 00:38:15,723
I don't know. I hope so.

623
00:38:15,725 --> 00:38:17,860
Can you wish on this kind of shooting star?

624
00:38:22,034 --> 00:38:24,032
Forget it.

625
00:38:24,034 --> 00:38:25,799
I wouldn't even know what to wish for.

626
00:38:28,134 --> 00:38:29,468
What about you?

627
00:39:16,720 --> 00:39:18,054
You should sleep.

628
00:39:21,993 --> 00:39:23,259
How?

629
00:39:43,476 --> 00:39:45,577
We make the best choices that we can...

630
00:39:47,415 --> 00:39:49,883
And then we put our
faith in a forgiving God.

631
00:39:52,187 --> 00:39:54,055
Do you think we deserve to be forgiven?

632
00:40:07,071 --> 00:40:08,573
Did you see that?

633
