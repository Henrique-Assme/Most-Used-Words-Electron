1
00:00:01,117 --> 00:00:02,854
I was born in space.

2
00:00:03,226 --> 00:00:05,448
I've never felt the sun on my face

3
00:00:05,485 --> 00:00:08,563
Or breathed real air
or floated in the water.

4
00:00:09,084 --> 00:00:10,325
None of us have.

5
00:00:10,516 --> 00:00:13,321
For 3 generations, the
Ark has kept what's left

6
00:00:13,383 --> 00:00:14,951
of the human race alive,

7
00:00:14,953 --> 00:00:17,087
but now our home is dying,

8
00:00:17,089 --> 00:00:19,956
and we are the last hope of mankind,

9
00:00:19,958 --> 00:00:22,659
100 prisoners sent on a desperate mission

10
00:00:22,661 --> 00:00:23,993
to the ground.

11
00:00:23,995 --> 00:00:26,196
Each of us is here
because we broke the law.

12
00:00:26,198 --> 00:00:28,698
On the ground, there is no law.

13
00:00:28,700 --> 00:00:30,433
All we have to do is survive,

14
00:00:30,435 --> 00:00:33,536
but we will be tested by the Earth,

15
00:00:33,538 --> 00:00:35,038
by the secrets it hides,

16
00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:37,580
and most of all by each other.

17
00:00:39,244 --> 00:00:40,810
Previously on "The 100."

18
00:00:40,812 --> 00:00:42,612
We know they've landed,
but communications are down.

19
00:00:42,614 --> 00:00:45,315
This wristband transmits
your vital signs to the Ark.

20
00:00:45,317 --> 00:00:47,283
Take them off, and Ark
will think we're dying.

21
00:00:47,285 --> 00:00:48,818
- That's the point.
- They've dumped you down here

22
00:00:48,820 --> 00:00:50,153
like lab rats to die,

23
00:00:50,155 --> 00:00:51,220
so why are you helping them?

24
00:00:51,222 --> 00:00:52,588
Chancellor's been shot.

25
00:00:52,590 --> 00:00:54,357
We have I.D.ed the
shooter... Bellamy Blake.

26
00:00:54,359 --> 00:00:57,293
I did something they will kill
me for when they come down.

27
00:00:57,295 --> 00:00:58,828
Do you see that peak over there?

28
00:00:58,830 --> 00:01:00,196
That's Mount Weather.

29
00:01:00,198 --> 00:01:01,998
There's a radiation-soaked
forest between us

30
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,200
- and our next meal.
- We did it!

31
00:01:05,903 --> 00:01:07,203
We are not alone.

32
00:01:11,074 --> 00:01:13,109
Clarke! Come on.

33
00:01:27,125 --> 00:01:28,724
Monty.

34
00:01:28,726 --> 00:01:30,192
- Come on!
- We got to go!

35
00:01:30,194 --> 00:01:31,837
Monty, get up!

36
00:01:35,365 --> 00:01:37,133
Who are they?

37
00:01:41,365 --> 00:01:42,823
What are they?

38
00:01:43,940 --> 00:01:45,547
We are so screwed.

39
00:01:50,648 --> 00:01:53,148
Jasper. He's alive.

40
00:01:53,150 --> 00:01:54,742
Clarke, wait. Wait!

41
00:01:56,951 --> 00:01:59,358
Wait. Stay out of the trees.

42
00:02:00,391 --> 00:02:01,690
He was right there.

43
00:02:02,278 --> 00:02:04,140
No. Where is he?

44
00:02:06,212 --> 00:02:07,463
They took him.

45
00:02:12,690 --> 00:02:17,729
- Sync and corrections by madhatters -
- www.MY-SUBS.com -

46
00:02:29,431 --> 00:02:32,254
- Talk to me, Jackson.
- Rumors are spreading.

47
00:02:32,268 --> 00:02:34,289
Witnesses saw a dropship launch.

48
00:02:34,291 --> 00:02:35,724
It's only a matter of time
till the people figure out

49
00:02:35,726 --> 00:02:37,158
that we sent the hundred to the ground.

50
00:02:37,160 --> 00:02:38,493
Let the council worry about the people.

51
00:02:38,495 --> 00:02:40,295
I need you focused on reestablishing

52
00:02:40,297 --> 00:02:42,831
communication with those kids.

53
00:02:42,833 --> 00:02:44,666
How many dark tiles?

54
00:02:44,668 --> 00:02:46,534
23. We've been losing them at

55
00:02:46,536 --> 00:02:47,802
a steady rate all day.

56
00:02:47,804 --> 00:02:49,671
Abby, these are different.

57
00:02:49,673 --> 00:02:51,706
Vital signs spike for a longer duration

58
00:02:51,708 --> 00:02:53,775
before flat line; It
looks like a pain response.

59
00:02:53,777 --> 00:02:56,010
This is what we'd expect to
see with exposure to radiation.

60
00:02:56,012 --> 00:02:57,645
I know what it looks like, Jackson,

61
00:02:57,647 --> 00:02:59,372
but there's another explanation.

62
00:03:02,127 --> 00:03:03,751
We just haven't found it yet.

63
00:03:03,753 --> 00:03:05,382
Chancellor on deck.

64
00:03:18,341 --> 00:03:19,934
My son.

65
00:03:30,267 --> 00:03:32,413
- We sent them down to die.
- No.

66
00:03:32,415 --> 00:03:34,127
We sent them down to live...

67
00:03:35,318 --> 00:03:38,255
To go to Earth to see if it was
survivable so that all of us could live.

68
00:03:38,292 --> 00:03:39,372
Abby, stop.

69
00:03:40,957 --> 00:03:42,924
I know this is hard,

70
00:03:42,926 --> 00:03:45,366
but we don't have time for false hope.

71
00:03:46,619 --> 00:03:49,217
This space station is dying,
and Earth is not survivable.

72
00:03:49,242 --> 00:03:50,398
That is what the wristbands are telling us.

73
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:52,431
We don't know what they're telling us yet.

74
00:03:55,604 --> 00:03:57,705
Thelonious,

75
00:03:57,707 --> 00:03:59,273
listen to me.

76
00:03:59,275 --> 00:04:02,543
Please trust me.

77
00:04:02,545 --> 00:04:05,279
For all we know, those kids
could be perfectly fine,

78
00:04:05,281 --> 00:04:07,322
including Wells.

79
00:04:43,452 --> 00:04:44,686
Get him!

80
00:04:45,865 --> 00:04:48,088
Way to go!

81
00:04:50,840 --> 00:04:52,693
I got it, I got it!

82
00:04:52,695 --> 00:04:54,661
Dude, get back here!

83
00:04:54,663 --> 00:04:56,697
- Move!
- Take it!

84
00:04:56,699 --> 00:04:58,496
See? Ha ha!

85
00:05:08,176 --> 00:05:10,054
Hey, where'd you get the clothes?

86
00:05:10,079 --> 00:05:12,646
Buried the two kids who
died during the landing.

87
00:05:12,648 --> 00:05:14,581
Smart. You know, I'll take it from here.

88
00:05:14,583 --> 00:05:15,916
There's always a market for...

89
00:05:15,918 --> 00:05:17,784
We share based on need,
just like back home.

90
00:05:17,786 --> 00:05:19,786
You still don't get it, do you, Chancellor?

91
00:05:24,959 --> 00:05:26,927
This is home now.

92
00:05:26,929 --> 00:05:30,463
Your father's rules no longer apply.

93
00:05:31,632 --> 00:05:34,167
Oh, no, no, Atom. Atom, hold up.

94
00:05:34,169 --> 00:05:36,618
You want it back? Take it.

95
00:05:43,377 --> 00:05:45,145
Get those boots!

96
00:05:45,147 --> 00:05:46,980
Is this what you want? Chaos?

97
00:05:46,982 --> 00:05:48,815
What's wrong with a little chaos?

98
00:05:55,389 --> 00:05:56,623
Bellamy.

99
00:05:56,625 --> 00:05:58,992
Check it out. We want the Ark to think

100
00:05:58,994 --> 00:06:00,793
that the ground is killing us, right?

101
00:06:00,795 --> 00:06:03,029
Figure it'll look better if
we suffer a little bit first.

102
00:06:03,031 --> 00:06:04,697
Let her go!

103
00:06:07,194 --> 00:06:08,334
You can stop this.

104
00:06:08,336 --> 00:06:09,902
Stop this?

105
00:06:09,904 --> 00:06:11,580
I'm just getting started.

106
00:06:12,607 --> 00:06:13,940
Fight!

107
00:06:33,448 --> 00:06:35,371
Don't you see you can't control this?

108
00:06:39,933 --> 00:06:40,962
You're dead.

109
00:06:41,632 --> 00:06:42,836
Wait.

110
00:06:48,959 --> 00:06:50,262
Fair fight.

111
00:07:08,595 --> 00:07:10,462
Aah!

112
00:07:10,464 --> 00:07:12,079
This is for my father!

113
00:07:14,501 --> 00:07:15,768
Drop it!

114
00:07:16,534 --> 00:07:17,903
Wells!

115
00:07:19,872 --> 00:07:21,262
Let him go!

116
00:07:23,777 --> 00:07:25,411
Whoa. Hey!

117
00:07:25,413 --> 00:07:26,912
Enough, Murphy.

118
00:07:26,914 --> 00:07:29,748
Octavia. Are you all right?

119
00:07:29,750 --> 00:07:31,283
Yeah.

120
00:07:31,285 --> 00:07:32,951
Where's the food?

121
00:07:34,814 --> 00:07:36,315
We didn't make it to Mount Weather.

122
00:07:36,317 --> 00:07:37,883
What the hell happened out there?

123
00:07:37,885 --> 00:07:39,485
We were attacked.

124
00:07:39,487 --> 00:07:42,154
Attacked? By what?

125
00:07:42,156 --> 00:07:44,656
Not what. Who.

126
00:07:44,658 --> 00:07:48,327
It turns out, when the last man
from the ground died on the Ark,

127
00:07:48,329 --> 00:07:50,462
he wasn't the last grounder.

128
00:07:50,464 --> 00:07:52,064
It's true.

129
00:07:52,066 --> 00:07:55,133
Everything we thought we knew
about the ground is wrong.

130
00:07:55,135 --> 00:07:57,202
There are people here,

131
00:07:57,204 --> 00:07:58,606
survivors.

132
00:07:59,273 --> 00:08:01,974
The good news is, that
means we can survive.

133
00:08:01,976 --> 00:08:03,942
Radiation won't kill us.

134
00:08:03,944 --> 00:08:06,678
Yeah, the bad news is the grounders will.

135
00:08:08,652 --> 00:08:10,182
Where's the kid with the goggles?

136
00:08:11,317 --> 00:08:13,151
Jasper was hit.

137
00:08:13,153 --> 00:08:15,087
They took him.

138
00:08:16,723 --> 00:08:18,374
Where is your wristband?

139
00:08:20,397 --> 00:08:21,526
Ask him.

140
00:08:24,050 --> 00:08:25,397
How many?

141
00:08:25,399 --> 00:08:27,401
24 and counting.

142
00:08:29,669 --> 00:08:30,962
You idiots.

143
00:08:32,712 --> 00:08:35,206
Life support on the Ark is failing.

144
00:08:35,208 --> 00:08:37,342
That's why they brought us down here.

145
00:08:37,344 --> 00:08:39,878
They need to know the
ground is survivable again,

146
00:08:39,880 --> 00:08:42,314
and we need their help
against whoever is out there.

147
00:08:42,316 --> 00:08:45,968
If you take off your wristbands,
you're not just killing them.

148
00:08:46,477 --> 00:08:48,186
You're killing us!

149
00:08:51,912 --> 00:08:53,558
We're stronger than you think.

150
00:08:53,560 --> 00:08:54,926
Don't listen to her.

151
00:08:54,928 --> 00:08:56,728
She's one of the privileged.

152
00:08:56,730 --> 00:08:59,363
If they come down, she'll have it good.

153
00:08:59,365 --> 00:09:01,966
How many of you can say the same?

154
00:09:01,968 --> 00:09:04,368
We can take care of ourselves.

155
00:09:04,370 --> 00:09:07,672
That wristband on your arm?
It makes you a prisoner.

156
00:09:07,674 --> 00:09:10,074
We are not prisoners anymore!

157
00:09:10,076 --> 00:09:12,543
They say they'll forgive your crimes.

158
00:09:12,545 --> 00:09:15,179
I say you're not criminals!

159
00:09:15,181 --> 00:09:18,249
You're fighters, survivors!

160
00:09:18,668 --> 00:09:21,385
The grounders should worry about us!

161
00:09:21,387 --> 00:09:22,987
- Yeah!
- Yeah!

162
00:09:27,762 --> 00:09:29,326
What do we do now?

163
00:09:29,328 --> 00:09:30,964
Now we go after Jasper.

164
00:09:32,441 --> 00:09:34,131
Why are you here, Abby?

165
00:09:34,133 --> 00:09:37,368
We both know that you could have
sent an apprentice to do this.

166
00:09:40,008 --> 00:09:42,106
Kane's planning a secret council meeting

167
00:09:42,108 --> 00:09:43,570
to vote on the culling.

168
00:09:44,577 --> 00:09:46,577
I need to know where you stand.

169
00:09:46,579 --> 00:09:48,012
I don't have a vote. You know that.

170
00:09:48,014 --> 00:09:49,585
They listen to you, Thelonious.

171
00:09:49,609 --> 00:09:51,223
Well, you don't.

172
00:09:51,620 --> 00:09:53,643
I do when you agree with me.

173
00:09:55,587 --> 00:09:59,590
Now, Abby, the CO2 scrubbers
are already failing.

174
00:09:59,592 --> 00:10:03,227
The symptoms of oxygen
deprivation are everywhere,

175
00:10:03,229 --> 00:10:06,220
and worst of all in the
children; They'll die first.

176
00:10:06,269 --> 00:10:08,677
- You don't have to tell me that.
- Obviously I do.

177
00:10:08,701 --> 00:10:11,435
Unless we act to reduce the population,

178
00:10:11,437 --> 00:10:15,072
everyone on-board this space
station will be dead in 4 months.

179
00:10:15,074 --> 00:10:17,941
We have acted. We put a
hundred kids on the ground.

180
00:10:17,943 --> 00:10:19,109
We need to give them time...

181
00:10:19,111 --> 00:10:21,859
There are 76 kids on the ground, Abby.

182
00:10:22,219 --> 00:10:23,447
24 of them,

183
00:10:23,484 --> 00:10:27,150
including my son, are already dead.

184
00:10:27,152 --> 00:10:29,565
- I don't think so.
- But you have no proof.

185
00:10:31,289 --> 00:10:34,599
Please... Stop.

186
00:10:38,263 --> 00:10:42,466
I understand your need
to have hope for Clarke,

187
00:10:42,468 --> 00:10:45,502
but I am the Chancellor of the Ark,

188
00:10:45,504 --> 00:10:47,537
and hope isn't enough.

189
00:10:47,539 --> 00:10:51,475
Not when the end of the
human race is at stake.

190
00:10:53,245 --> 00:10:54,978
You wanted to see me?

191
00:10:56,347 --> 00:10:58,190
Hope is everything,

192
00:10:59,618 --> 00:11:02,752
and the Chancellor that I voted for,

193
00:11:02,754 --> 00:11:04,243
he knew that.

194
00:11:07,024 --> 00:11:08,825
I'm done here.

195
00:11:22,840 --> 00:11:25,642
Stop studying me, Kane.

196
00:11:31,382 --> 00:11:33,149
Who shot me?

197
00:11:33,151 --> 00:11:34,818
Bellamy Blake,

198
00:11:34,820 --> 00:11:37,320
a janitor from factory station.

199
00:11:37,322 --> 00:11:38,688
He stowed away on the dropship.

200
00:11:38,690 --> 00:11:40,523
We're still investigating who helped him.

201
00:11:41,826 --> 00:11:44,661
Who benefits most from my death?

202
00:11:47,418 --> 00:11:49,666
If you have something to say, just say it.

203
00:11:51,835 --> 00:11:55,939
You rushed to execute the
woman who saved my life,

204
00:11:56,515 --> 00:11:58,841
and if I were dead, you
would be Chancellor now

205
00:11:58,843 --> 00:12:01,778
and Abby wouldn't be here to oppose you.

206
00:12:01,780 --> 00:12:04,647
I followed the law. I did my job.

207
00:12:04,649 --> 00:12:07,467
You were the acting Chancellor...

208
00:12:09,390 --> 00:12:13,055
And this job requires more
than simply following the law.

209
00:12:13,057 --> 00:12:17,260
It requires knowing when not to.

210
00:12:20,630 --> 00:12:24,066
I had nothing to do with
the attempt on your life,

211
00:12:24,068 --> 00:12:26,635
but I'm not surprised that it happened.

212
00:12:27,904 --> 00:12:31,440
You're too weak to do
what now has to be done,

213
00:12:31,442 --> 00:12:33,417
and I'm not the only one who knows it.

214
00:13:01,639 --> 00:13:02,998
There you are.

215
00:13:08,278 --> 00:13:11,013
When my father said they didn't
leave us anything, he really meant it.

216
00:13:17,887 --> 00:13:20,489
It's just a scratch.

217
00:13:20,491 --> 00:13:22,179
You're making friends fast.

218
00:13:23,234 --> 00:13:25,629
Keep it covered. It could get infected.

219
00:13:27,094 --> 00:13:28,330
Nice pack.

220
00:13:28,332 --> 00:13:30,676
Yeah, seat belts and insulation.

221
00:13:30,677 --> 00:13:32,122
I also packed part of the parachute,

222
00:13:32,134 --> 00:13:33,490
figured we could use it
to carry out Jasper.

223
00:13:33,515 --> 00:13:36,505
Good. Give it to someone else.

224
00:13:36,507 --> 00:13:38,974
- You're not coming with us.
- My ankle's fine.

225
00:13:38,976 --> 00:13:42,277
It's not your ankle, Wells, it's you.

226
00:13:42,279 --> 00:13:45,113
You came back for
reinforcements. I'm gonna help.

227
00:13:45,115 --> 00:13:47,616
Clarke, he's right. We need him.

228
00:13:47,618 --> 00:13:49,651
So far no one else has volunteered.

229
00:13:49,653 --> 00:13:51,319
I'm sorry, Monty, but
you're not going, either.

230
00:13:51,321 --> 00:13:53,622
Like hell I'm not. Jasper's my best friend.

231
00:13:53,624 --> 00:13:54,741
You're too important.

232
00:13:54,766 --> 00:13:57,559
You were raised on farm station
and recruited by engineering.

233
00:13:57,561 --> 00:14:00,428
- So?
- So food and communication.

234
00:14:00,430 --> 00:14:02,797
What's up here, it's gonna save us all.

235
00:14:02,799 --> 00:14:06,734
You figure out how to talk to the
Ark and I'll bring Jasper back.

236
00:14:06,736 --> 00:14:08,903
Hey. You ready?

237
00:14:08,905 --> 00:14:11,606
I'm not going anywhere, and
neither should any of you.

238
00:14:11,608 --> 00:14:14,275
That spear was thrown with
pinpoint accuracy from 300 feet.

239
00:14:14,277 --> 00:14:17,378
- So what, we let Jasper die?
- That's not gonna happen.

240
00:14:17,380 --> 00:14:19,380
Spacewalker?

241
00:14:19,382 --> 00:14:21,149
What a joke.

242
00:14:21,151 --> 00:14:22,517
You think you're such an adventurer.

243
00:14:22,519 --> 00:14:24,485
You're really just a coward.

244
00:14:24,487 --> 00:14:26,487
It's not an adventure, Clarke,

245
00:14:26,489 --> 00:14:28,489
it's a suicide mission.

246
00:14:33,836 --> 00:14:34,862
Build a wall.

247
00:14:34,864 --> 00:14:38,032
Use the fallen trees.
I'll watch out for her.

248
00:14:39,781 --> 00:14:41,569
Jasper looked up to you.

249
00:14:49,179 --> 00:14:51,045
- What the hell was it?
- I don't know.

250
00:14:51,047 --> 00:14:53,180
The others said it
looked like a giant snake.

251
00:14:53,182 --> 00:14:54,415
You could have been killed.

252
00:14:54,417 --> 00:14:55,750
She would have been if Jasper

253
00:14:55,752 --> 00:14:57,084
didn't jump in to pull her out.

254
00:14:57,086 --> 00:14:58,719
You guys leaving? I'm coming, too.

255
00:14:58,721 --> 00:15:00,521
No, no. No way. Not again.

256
00:15:00,523 --> 00:15:03,259
He's right. Your leg's
just gonna slow us down.

257
00:15:03,297 --> 00:15:04,540
I'm here for you.

258
00:15:05,094 --> 00:15:06,227
Clarke, what are you doing?

259
00:15:06,229 --> 00:15:07,530
I hear you have a gun.

260
00:15:09,898 --> 00:15:11,899
Good. Follow me.

261
00:15:11,901 --> 00:15:14,201
And why would I do that?

262
00:15:15,604 --> 00:15:18,873
Because you want them to follow you,

263
00:15:18,875 --> 00:15:23,077
and right now, they're thinking
only one of us is scared.

264
00:15:27,315 --> 00:15:28,949
Murphy.

265
00:15:28,951 --> 00:15:31,685
Come with me. Atom?

266
00:15:31,687 --> 00:15:34,355
My sister doesn't leave
this camp. Is that clear?

267
00:15:34,357 --> 00:15:36,957
I don't need a babysitter.

268
00:15:36,959 --> 00:15:39,793
Anybody touches her, they answer to me.

269
00:15:41,062 --> 00:15:42,463
Let's go.

270
00:15:44,466 --> 00:15:46,633
You're staying here.

271
00:15:46,635 --> 00:15:49,012
I'm gonna make your life a living hell.

272
00:15:52,574 --> 00:15:54,575
Those guys aren't just bullies, Clarke.

273
00:15:54,577 --> 00:15:56,810
They're dangerous criminals.

274
00:15:56,812 --> 00:15:59,580
I'm counting on it.

275
00:15:59,582 --> 00:16:02,616
Since when are we in the
rescuing business, huh?

276
00:16:02,618 --> 00:16:04,585
The Ark thinks the prince is dead.

277
00:16:04,587 --> 00:16:07,788
Once they think the princess
is, too, they'll never come down.

278
00:16:09,812 --> 00:16:11,624
I'm getting that wristband,

279
00:16:11,661 --> 00:16:14,193
even if I have to cut
off her hand to do it.

280
00:16:38,742 --> 00:16:40,776
Damn it, Raven.

281
00:16:40,778 --> 00:16:43,579
Wait for pressurization.

282
00:16:46,382 --> 00:16:49,284
Sorry, boys. Places to go.

283
00:16:50,720 --> 00:16:53,722
Did anyone notice there's
no damage to "B" dock?

284
00:16:53,724 --> 00:16:55,257
"B" dock's restricted. You know that.

285
00:16:55,269 --> 00:16:57,259
What, are they gonna float me for looking?

286
00:16:58,099 --> 00:16:59,911
Guys, come on.

287
00:16:59,948 --> 00:17:02,308
An exodus ship was launched.

288
00:17:02,333 --> 00:17:04,333
You're not curious about that?

289
00:17:04,335 --> 00:17:06,568
It was not launched. It was ejected.

290
00:17:06,570 --> 00:17:08,137
According to engineering,

291
00:17:08,139 --> 00:17:10,405
a routine maintenance
accident forced them to eject.

292
00:17:10,407 --> 00:17:13,008
A maintenance accident that
didn't cause any damage?

293
00:17:13,010 --> 00:17:15,344
That's a lie and you know it.

294
00:17:15,346 --> 00:17:18,514
Fine. Well, if that doesn't stir your tank,

295
00:17:18,516 --> 00:17:20,482
how about this?

296
00:17:20,484 --> 00:17:23,285
Why would they build a
dropship in the first place?

297
00:17:23,287 --> 00:17:25,287
Just slow down, all right?
We need to check your vitals.

298
00:17:25,289 --> 00:17:27,556
I'll save you the trouble.

299
00:17:27,558 --> 00:17:29,491
I feel good.

300
00:17:29,493 --> 00:17:32,628
Prison visiting day. Tell
lover boy I'll pay him

301
00:17:32,630 --> 00:17:34,529
the two days' rations I
owe him when he gets out.

302
00:17:34,531 --> 00:17:36,531
It was 3 days. Hey, stash my gear.

303
00:17:36,533 --> 00:17:37,799
I'll come back for it later.

304
00:17:37,801 --> 00:17:40,035
Ok, Raven, stop.

305
00:17:40,037 --> 00:17:41,803
Lockup's been quarantined.

306
00:17:41,805 --> 00:17:43,772
There's some kind of a virus.

307
00:17:43,774 --> 00:17:46,641
There's no visitation for
at least two months. Sorry.

308
00:17:51,148 --> 00:17:52,748
Hey, I saw that. You cheated.

309
00:17:52,750 --> 00:17:55,984
Hey, guys, the wall's
not gonna build itself.

310
00:17:55,986 --> 00:17:59,054
Walls won't stop what's
out there. We need weapons.

311
00:17:59,056 --> 00:18:01,223
So build weapons. Look...

312
00:18:01,225 --> 00:18:03,692
Your brother wasn't kidding
about that. He'll hurt them.

313
00:18:03,694 --> 00:18:05,327
Come on. We were just talking.

314
00:18:05,329 --> 00:18:07,529
You're too hot to be my brother's bitch.

315
00:18:07,531 --> 00:18:10,966
- I'm no one's bitch.
- Mmm. Good.

316
00:18:13,899 --> 00:18:15,103
Then prove it.

317
00:18:18,040 --> 00:18:20,208
Come with me.

318
00:18:36,859 --> 00:18:38,927
- Hey. Oof!
- Get out of here.

319
00:18:43,110 --> 00:18:44,710
Nobody's bitch, huh?

320
00:18:47,942 --> 00:18:51,139
Maybe one of these days you'll
realize you can't control me.

321
00:18:52,546 --> 00:18:54,444
You know, that guy you with?

322
00:18:55,245 --> 00:18:56,947
Did you know he was in for murder?

323
00:18:58,374 --> 00:18:59,414
You want to know something funny?

324
00:18:59,416 --> 00:19:01,464
I'm actually protecting him from you.

325
00:19:04,820 --> 00:19:08,056
Hey, hey, hey, hey! What are you doing?!

326
00:19:08,793 --> 00:19:10,124
Consider yourself controlled.

327
00:19:10,126 --> 00:19:12,927
Is this all you got? They
locked me under the floor

328
00:19:12,929 --> 00:19:15,763
for 16 years just for being born!

329
00:19:16,685 --> 00:19:17,699
This is nothing.

330
00:19:17,701 --> 00:19:20,168
Ahem. You want to keep it down?

331
00:19:21,856 --> 00:19:23,332
I'm trying to concentrate.

332
00:19:28,051 --> 00:19:30,583
Attention. The mess hall will be closed

333
00:19:30,595 --> 00:19:32,813
from 2100 hours to 0800 hours

334
00:19:32,815 --> 00:19:34,182
for maintenance.

335
00:19:34,184 --> 00:19:35,516
Attention.

336
00:19:35,518 --> 00:19:39,186
The mess hall will be
closed from 2100 hours...

337
00:19:39,188 --> 00:19:41,422
Abby...

338
00:19:41,424 --> 00:19:43,391
Kane's lobbying for votes.

339
00:19:43,393 --> 00:19:45,192
We should, too.

340
00:19:46,796 --> 00:19:49,630
We'll have our chance at the briefing.

341
00:19:51,902 --> 00:19:53,467
Excuse me! Dr. Griffin.

342
00:19:53,469 --> 00:19:55,636
I have a question about the quarantine.

343
00:19:55,638 --> 00:19:58,105
My boyfriend's in lockup.
I went to go see him.

344
00:19:58,107 --> 00:20:00,274
Instead, I saw an open air duct.

345
00:20:00,276 --> 00:20:03,144
Now, if there really was a virus,
wouldn't you move to contain the airflow?

346
00:20:03,146 --> 00:20:04,645
The virus isn't airborne.

347
00:20:04,647 --> 00:20:06,547
That's why the ducts are open.

348
00:20:06,961 --> 00:20:09,517
Can you tell me if he's ok?

349
00:20:09,519 --> 00:20:11,585
I can't. I'm sorry.

350
00:20:13,335 --> 00:20:14,722
No, you're not.

351
00:20:15,395 --> 00:20:17,358
First the dropship, now this.

352
00:20:17,360 --> 00:20:19,526
The council's hiding something,

353
00:20:20,163 --> 00:20:21,895
and I'm gonna find out what it is.

354
00:20:24,032 --> 00:20:25,338
Ballsy kid.

355
00:20:26,616 --> 00:20:28,035
Yeah.

356
00:20:28,788 --> 00:20:30,639
Reminds me of someone.

357
00:20:31,743 --> 00:20:33,740
Hey, hold up.

358
00:20:35,367 --> 00:20:36,709
What's the rush?

359
00:20:36,711 --> 00:20:38,133
You don't survive a
spear through the heart.

360
00:20:38,140 --> 00:20:39,375
Put the gun away, Bellamy.

361
00:20:39,415 --> 00:20:40,981
Well, why don't you do
something about it, huh?

362
00:20:40,983 --> 00:20:42,950
Jasper screamed when they moved him.

363
00:20:42,952 --> 00:20:45,986
If the spear struck his heart,
he'd have died instantly.

364
00:20:45,988 --> 00:20:47,554
It doesn't mean we have time to waste.

365
00:20:47,556 --> 00:20:50,245
As soon as you take this
wristband off, we can go.

366
00:20:51,833 --> 00:20:55,896
The only way the Ark is gonna
think I'm dead is if I'm dead.

367
00:20:55,898 --> 00:20:57,020
Got it?

368
00:20:58,460 --> 00:20:59,866
Brave princess.

369
00:21:00,408 --> 00:21:02,869
Hey, why don't you find your own nickname?

370
00:21:03,293 --> 00:21:04,871
You call this a rescue party?

371
00:21:04,873 --> 00:21:06,873
Got to split up, cover more ground.

372
00:21:06,875 --> 00:21:09,109
Clarke, come with me.

373
00:21:10,111 --> 00:21:11,978
Better late than never.

374
00:21:11,980 --> 00:21:13,524
I like to think so.

375
00:21:28,519 --> 00:21:31,555
Guess we got more in common
than meets the eye, huh?

376
00:21:31,557 --> 00:21:33,590
We have nothing in common.

377
00:21:33,592 --> 00:21:35,125
No?

378
00:21:35,127 --> 00:21:38,361
Both came down here to
protect someone we love.

379
00:21:39,932 --> 00:21:41,619
Your secret's safe with me.

380
00:21:42,167 --> 00:21:44,834
'Course, for you it's worse.

381
00:21:44,836 --> 00:21:46,803
With Finn around,

382
00:21:46,805 --> 00:21:48,805
Clarke doesn't even see you.

383
00:21:48,807 --> 00:21:50,626
It's like you're not even here.

384
00:21:55,019 --> 00:21:59,282
He may not be my real brother...
... But he's always been there.

385
00:21:59,284 --> 00:22:02,485
Every memory I have, there's Jasper.

386
00:22:04,622 --> 00:22:05,989
I should be out there.

387
00:22:07,024 --> 00:22:08,816
You're not gonna cry, are you?

388
00:22:10,007 --> 00:22:11,027
Shut up.

389
00:22:13,164 --> 00:22:15,531
You sure about this?
Your brother won't approve

390
00:22:15,533 --> 00:22:17,200
of you helping us contact the Ark.

391
00:22:17,202 --> 00:22:18,443
He's not my keeper.

392
00:22:19,883 --> 00:22:21,685
Let's just do this. Let's do it.

393
00:22:29,446 --> 00:22:32,014
Aah!

394
00:22:32,016 --> 00:22:33,483
Ow!

395
00:22:33,485 --> 00:22:34,815
- Son of a...
- Sorry.

396
00:22:38,388 --> 00:22:39,989
- Dead.
- Oh.

397
00:22:39,991 --> 00:22:41,324
Damn it.

398
00:22:41,326 --> 00:22:42,792
If we can't even take it off,

399
00:22:42,794 --> 00:22:44,805
how do you expect to turn it into a radio?

400
00:22:52,183 --> 00:22:53,469
Go on.

401
00:22:53,471 --> 00:22:55,943
I'll be fine. Work to do.

402
00:23:03,413 --> 00:23:04,747
Hey, Monty?

403
00:23:05,283 --> 00:23:07,142
Jasper would understand why you stayed.

404
00:23:09,886 --> 00:23:13,522
How is someone raised beneath
the floor not a total basket case?

405
00:23:13,524 --> 00:23:15,848
Who says I'm not?

406
00:23:19,596 --> 00:23:21,321
It's because he loves you.

407
00:23:21,991 --> 00:23:23,532
Your brother?

408
00:23:23,534 --> 00:23:25,982
You're not a basket case
because you were loved.

409
00:23:27,744 --> 00:23:28,904
Yeah, I'm a lucky girl.

410
00:23:28,906 --> 00:23:32,149
I'm not saying I had it worse than
you, Octavia, because I didn't.

411
00:23:33,440 --> 00:23:35,516
But you have someone who
would do anything for you.

412
00:23:36,695 --> 00:23:37,946
I envy that.

413
00:23:44,476 --> 00:23:46,722
I've been thinking about Mount Weather.

414
00:23:46,724 --> 00:23:49,582
How come they didn't attack
until Jasper crossed the river?

415
00:23:50,215 --> 00:23:52,994
It's not like we were being quiet
and they didn't know we were there.

416
00:23:54,943 --> 00:23:56,826
They waited for us to cross.

417
00:23:58,179 --> 00:23:59,768
The river's a boundary.

418
00:24:00,624 --> 00:24:02,738
Which means Mount Weather is off limits.

419
00:24:03,267 --> 00:24:05,607
How are we gonna get those supplies?

420
00:24:05,609 --> 00:24:07,902
What are we gonna do for food?

421
00:24:20,528 --> 00:24:21,490
Wow.

422
00:24:24,784 --> 00:24:26,928
Well, at least we don't
have to worry about water.

423
00:24:39,442 --> 00:24:40,819
Oh, yeah.

424
00:24:46,874 --> 00:24:49,084
Come on, Finn. We don't have time for this.

425
00:24:49,086 --> 00:24:51,786
Clarke, we've been hiking for hours.

426
00:24:51,788 --> 00:24:53,288
We need to take a break.

427
00:24:53,290 --> 00:24:54,956
I'll take a break when we find Jasper.

428
00:24:54,958 --> 00:24:55,955
Come on.

429
00:25:01,312 --> 00:25:04,165
No, no. Finn! Don't!

430
00:25:05,569 --> 00:25:06,968
Damn it, Finn!

431
00:25:11,473 --> 00:25:14,042
Oh, wow. Ok.

432
00:25:14,044 --> 00:25:16,911
- Maybe just a minute.
- Yeah.

433
00:25:21,116 --> 00:25:24,118
I think I know why you're so
hell-bent on finding Jasper,

434
00:25:24,120 --> 00:25:26,320
why you're always taking
care of everybody else.

435
00:25:26,322 --> 00:25:29,357
Now you sound like my mother.

436
00:25:29,359 --> 00:25:31,359
No. Go on. This should be good.

437
00:25:31,361 --> 00:25:33,528
The delinquent psychiatrist.

438
00:25:38,182 --> 00:25:39,981
You couldn't save your father.

439
00:26:16,807 --> 00:26:18,483
Jasper. He was here.

440
00:26:19,375 --> 00:26:21,002
We should get the others.

441
00:26:28,012 --> 00:26:29,204
We're close.

442
00:26:36,816 --> 00:26:38,210
Abby, we have to stop.

443
00:26:38,212 --> 00:26:39,678
The council vote's in 30 minutes.

444
00:26:39,680 --> 00:26:41,146
Then we have 30 minutes.

445
00:26:41,148 --> 00:26:43,515
- Anything from engineering?
- Nothing good.

446
00:26:43,517 --> 00:26:46,184
According to Sinclair, even if we
sent a signal down, the wristbands

447
00:26:46,186 --> 00:26:48,253
weren't designed to receive, so
the kids wouldn't even hear it.

448
00:26:48,255 --> 00:26:50,088
There's got to be something
we missed, something

449
00:26:50,090 --> 00:26:52,257
that we haven't thought of.

450
00:26:52,259 --> 00:26:54,626
Great. What's falling apart now?

451
00:26:57,531 --> 00:26:59,364
Hey! Hey!

452
00:27:04,004 --> 00:27:05,770
Apparently you have a thing for air ducts.

453
00:27:05,772 --> 00:27:07,639
I'll call security.

454
00:27:07,641 --> 00:27:09,378
They're not dying.

455
00:27:11,462 --> 00:27:13,144
What are you talking about?

456
00:27:16,048 --> 00:27:18,031
All that's being sent from the ground?

457
00:27:23,188 --> 00:27:24,794
Transmitted by these.

458
00:27:30,139 --> 00:27:31,343
They're taking them off.

459
00:27:31,777 --> 00:27:34,899
What? Why would they do
something so reckless?

460
00:27:34,901 --> 00:27:37,301
Because we told them not to.

461
00:28:04,721 --> 00:28:06,272
Hello, beautiful.

462
00:28:15,618 --> 00:28:17,641
Hey, where are you going?

463
00:29:46,130 --> 00:29:47,724
It's ok.

464
00:29:48,530 --> 00:29:50,934
We've got nothing but time.

465
00:30:02,843 --> 00:30:05,081
Hey, how do we know this is the right way?

466
00:30:05,083 --> 00:30:08,318
We don't. Spacewalker
thinks he's a tracker.

467
00:30:08,320 --> 00:30:11,254
It's called "cutting sign."
Fourth-year earth skills. He's good.

468
00:30:11,256 --> 00:30:14,060
You want to keep it down or should
I paint a target on your backs?

469
00:30:27,556 --> 00:30:29,958
See? You're invisible.

470
00:30:34,079 --> 00:30:35,812
What the hell was that?

471
00:30:35,814 --> 00:30:37,875
Now would be a good time
to take out that gun.

472
00:30:44,421 --> 00:30:45,422
Jasper.

473
00:30:55,033 --> 00:30:56,848
- Oh, my God.
- Clarke, be careful.

474
00:30:56,850 --> 00:30:57,912
Jasper?

475
00:30:59,501 --> 00:31:00,818
What the hell is this?

476
00:31:03,307 --> 00:31:05,293
Clarke! Get her up!

477
00:31:06,757 --> 00:31:08,860
Pull her up! Pull her
up! Get her! Pull her up!

478
00:31:13,539 --> 00:31:15,475
- You ok?
- Yeah.

479
00:31:23,249 --> 00:31:24,475
We need to get him down.

480
00:31:24,477 --> 00:31:26,010
I'll climb up there and cut the vines.

481
00:31:26,012 --> 00:31:28,812
- Yeah, yeah, I'm with you.
- No. Stay with Clarke.

482
00:31:28,814 --> 00:31:30,748
And watch him.

483
00:31:30,750 --> 00:31:32,316
You. Let's go.

484
00:31:32,831 --> 00:31:35,119
There's a poultice on his wound.

485
00:31:35,121 --> 00:31:38,522
Medicine? Why would they save his life
just to string him up as live bait?

486
00:31:38,524 --> 00:31:40,891
Maybe what they're trying to catch
likes its dinner to be breathing.

487
00:31:40,893 --> 00:31:42,696
Maybe what they're trying to catch is us.

488
00:31:46,075 --> 00:31:48,766
Data indicates that the
violent criminals in the group

489
00:31:48,768 --> 00:31:52,402
are 8 times more likely
to have terminated signals.

490
00:31:52,404 --> 00:31:55,772
We believe that this means that the kids

491
00:31:55,774 --> 00:31:58,642
are taking off the wristbands by choice.

492
00:31:58,644 --> 00:32:00,377
So how do you explain Wells?

493
00:32:00,379 --> 00:32:02,412
Kane is right.

494
00:32:02,414 --> 00:32:07,951
My son would... Never take
his wristband off voluntarily.

495
00:32:07,953 --> 00:32:09,953
Both our children have done things

496
00:32:09,955 --> 00:32:12,389
that we could never have predicted.

497
00:32:12,391 --> 00:32:13,857
The point holds.

498
00:32:13,859 --> 00:32:15,492
These children need more time.

499
00:32:15,494 --> 00:32:16,760
We don't have time.

500
00:32:16,762 --> 00:32:18,795
Engineering needs 6 months

501
00:32:18,797 --> 00:32:20,261
to fix life support,

502
00:32:20,766 --> 00:32:23,567
and we'll be out of oxygen in 4.

503
00:32:26,337 --> 00:32:30,574
Nobody wants to do this, but the
inescapable fact is that for every day

504
00:32:30,576 --> 00:32:34,878
we delay, 10 more people
will need to be sacrificed.

505
00:32:34,880 --> 00:32:37,881
So today it's 209, tomorrow it's 219.

506
00:32:37,883 --> 00:32:39,883
The day after that is 229.

507
00:32:39,885 --> 00:32:42,852
We're the ones who need more time.

508
00:32:42,854 --> 00:32:44,955
I move that we vote now.

509
00:32:44,957 --> 00:32:46,923
- I second that.
- Very well.

510
00:32:46,925 --> 00:32:49,826
The matter before us requires
a 4-vote majority to pass.

511
00:32:49,828 --> 00:32:53,963
A vote in favor is to vote to
cull 209 citizens of the Ark

512
00:32:53,965 --> 00:32:56,733
from the supply grid in
order to extend life support

513
00:32:56,735 --> 00:32:59,769
for those who remain by 6 months.

514
00:33:00,505 --> 00:33:02,071
All those in favor?

515
00:33:02,073 --> 00:33:04,040
Aye.

516
00:33:04,042 --> 00:33:05,508
- Aye.
- Aye.

517
00:33:05,510 --> 00:33:07,544
All those opposed?

518
00:33:07,546 --> 00:33:09,546
- Nay.
- Nay.

519
00:33:09,548 --> 00:33:11,214
3 votes to 3.

520
00:33:11,216 --> 00:33:13,128
The Chancellor will break the tie.

521
00:33:15,719 --> 00:33:18,921
We didn't ask for this.

522
00:33:22,159 --> 00:33:25,962
Ours was to be a transitional generation...

523
00:33:27,398 --> 00:33:30,633
Ensuring that 3 generations from now

524
00:33:30,635 --> 00:33:32,802
mankind could go home.

525
00:33:32,804 --> 00:33:35,171
But everything has changed,

526
00:33:35,173 --> 00:33:39,842
and we will either be
the generation that sees

527
00:33:39,844 --> 00:33:42,461
the human race return to Earth...

528
00:33:43,479 --> 00:33:46,706
Or upon whose watch...

529
00:33:48,368 --> 00:33:50,044
It finally ends.

530
00:33:52,593 --> 00:33:54,666
My son is already down there.

531
00:33:57,123 --> 00:33:58,128
I sent him.

532
00:34:02,198 --> 00:34:04,282
And the truth is I don't know

533
00:34:05,002 --> 00:34:08,437
if he is alive or dead.

534
00:34:11,434 --> 00:34:13,059
But I still have hope.

535
00:34:14,403 --> 00:34:16,897
How does the Chancellor vote?

536
00:34:20,572 --> 00:34:21,951
I don't.

537
00:34:21,953 --> 00:34:25,387
Sir, if you abstain, the vote ends in a tie

538
00:34:25,389 --> 00:34:28,724
to be automatically
taken up again in 10 days.

539
00:34:28,726 --> 00:34:30,960
That's 10 more dead for every day.

540
00:34:30,962 --> 00:34:33,996
I ask again, how does the Chancellor vote?

541
00:34:33,998 --> 00:34:35,698
The Chancellor abstains.

542
00:34:40,237 --> 00:34:42,337
You have 10 days.

543
00:34:49,658 --> 00:34:50,946
Hurry up, Murphy.

544
00:34:50,948 --> 00:34:52,948
Be careful.

545
00:34:55,119 --> 00:34:56,652
What the hell was that?

546
00:34:57,909 --> 00:34:58,954
Grounders?

547
00:35:07,131 --> 00:35:09,031
Bellamy, gun!

548
00:35:39,886 --> 00:35:41,375
Now she sees you.

549
00:35:46,944 --> 00:35:49,512
Did someone call for a mechanic?

550
00:35:54,262 --> 00:35:55,951
You're the one who
called in the work order?

551
00:35:56,540 --> 00:35:58,004
We need to talk.

552
00:36:05,228 --> 00:36:09,231
Look, I told you I'm not
gonna say anything, ok?

553
00:36:09,233 --> 00:36:11,834
I believe you, and you're not in trouble.

554
00:36:11,836 --> 00:36:13,435
Follow me.

555
00:36:13,437 --> 00:36:15,471
Not in trouble yet, you mean.

556
00:36:17,074 --> 00:36:19,575
This level's off limits for people like me.

557
00:36:19,577 --> 00:36:21,076
Not anymore.

558
00:36:21,078 --> 00:36:24,112
You know that we sent the
hundred down to the ground.

559
00:36:24,114 --> 00:36:25,605
What you don't know is why.

560
00:36:26,417 --> 00:36:28,150
The Ark is dying, Raven.

561
00:36:28,152 --> 00:36:31,787
Life support is on its last legs.

562
00:36:31,789 --> 00:36:35,424
I have 10 days to prove
that Earth is survivable

563
00:36:36,105 --> 00:36:38,260
or they're gonna start reducing population.

564
00:36:38,262 --> 00:36:41,930
320 innocent people will be killed.

565
00:36:42,491 --> 00:36:43,899
I don't get it.

566
00:36:43,901 --> 00:36:44,966
Why are you telling me this?

567
00:36:44,968 --> 00:36:46,268
I looked up your file.

568
00:36:46,270 --> 00:36:48,170
You're the youngest zero-g mechanic

569
00:36:48,172 --> 00:36:50,138
on the Ark in 50 years.

570
00:36:50,140 --> 00:36:53,809
52, but... So what?

571
00:36:53,811 --> 00:36:54,925
so...

572
00:37:00,783 --> 00:37:04,553
You have 9 days to get this
ready so I can survive a drop.

573
00:37:10,760 --> 00:37:13,295
God, what a piece of junk.

574
00:37:13,297 --> 00:37:15,807
They must have found
this thing when they...

575
00:37:16,299 --> 00:37:19,300
Salvaged MIR-3 in 2102.

576
00:37:19,302 --> 00:37:23,304
You want me to get a
130-year-old escape pod

577
00:37:23,306 --> 00:37:26,341
ready to stand up to
the inferno of re-entry

578
00:37:26,343 --> 00:37:28,710
in 9 days?

579
00:37:28,712 --> 00:37:30,137
Can you do it or not?

580
00:37:34,847 --> 00:37:38,119
Hell, yes, I can do it,
but I'm going with you.

581
00:37:38,121 --> 00:37:40,834
You're not the only one with
someone you love on the ground.

582
00:37:42,811 --> 00:37:44,058
Those are my terms.

583
00:37:44,337 --> 00:37:46,494
Take it or leave it.

584
00:37:49,498 --> 00:37:51,699
All right. You can come with me.

585
00:37:52,522 --> 00:37:54,234
You got yourself a mechanic.

586
00:38:07,115 --> 00:38:08,581
They're back!

587
00:38:10,058 --> 00:38:11,185
Over there.

588
00:38:15,083 --> 00:38:16,824
- Is he...
- He's alive.

589
00:38:16,826 --> 00:38:19,894
I need boiled water and
strips of cloth for bandage.

590
00:38:26,835 --> 00:38:28,436
- Oh!
- Oh, ho ho!

591
00:38:28,438 --> 00:38:31,605
- Who's hungry?!
- Yeah!

592
00:38:33,209 --> 00:38:35,376
Bellamy! Whoo!

593
00:39:48,117 --> 00:39:50,917
He's stable for now,
but without medicine...

594
00:39:52,922 --> 00:39:55,622
They're taking off their
wristbands for food?

595
00:39:55,624 --> 00:39:57,857
No way. I... I won't do it.

596
00:39:57,859 --> 00:39:59,426
You don't have to.

597
00:40:04,299 --> 00:40:06,933
Whoa, whoa. Wait, wait, wait.

598
00:40:06,935 --> 00:40:09,669
What, you think you
play by different rules?

599
00:40:10,474 --> 00:40:12,360
I thought there were no rules.

600
00:40:22,439 --> 00:40:23,730
Hey.

601
00:40:34,162 --> 00:40:35,328
Atom!

602
00:40:39,701 --> 00:40:43,069
Come on. We're on first watch.

603
00:40:50,645 --> 00:40:53,045
Guys, you're not just gonna leave me here.

604
00:40:53,047 --> 00:40:56,333
No, Atom. I won't be disobeyed.

605
00:41:04,893 --> 00:41:06,332
Guys!

606
00:41:08,730 --> 00:41:09,762
Bellamy!

607
00:41:10,544 --> 00:41:13,299
Guys! Bellamy!
