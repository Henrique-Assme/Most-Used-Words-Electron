﻿1
00:00:07,719 --> 00:00:10,597
I feel the sun on my face.

2
00:00:10,824 --> 00:00:13,467
I see trees all around me,

3
00:00:13,587 --> 00:00:16,314
scent of wildflowers on a breeze.

4
00:00:16,718 --> 00:00:18,751
It's so beautiful.

5
00:00:23,290 --> 00:00:26,726
In this moment, I'm not stranded in space.

6
00:00:28,555 --> 00:00:31,564
It's been 97 years since
a nuclear apocalypse

7
00:00:31,566 --> 00:00:32,878
killed everyone on Earth,

8
00:00:32,884 --> 00:00:35,362
leaving the planet simmering in radiation.

9
00:00:35,482 --> 00:00:38,734
Fortunately, there were survivors.

10
00:00:39,021 --> 00:00:41,374
12 nations had operational space stations

11
00:00:41,376 --> 00:00:43,876
at the time of the bombs.

12
00:00:43,878 --> 00:00:45,785
There is now only The Ark,

13
00:00:45,905 --> 00:00:48,576
one station forged from the many.

14
00:00:50,265 --> 00:00:52,536
We're told the Earth
needs another 100 years

15
00:00:52,567 --> 00:00:54,754
to become survivable again.

16
00:00:54,756 --> 00:00:56,889
4 more space-locked generations,

17
00:00:56,891 --> 00:00:59,793
and man can go home, back to the ground.

18
00:00:59,831 --> 00:01:04,385
The ground, that's the
dream. This is reality.

19
00:01:06,067 --> 00:01:07,967
Prisoner 319, face the wall.

20
00:01:07,969 --> 00:01:10,636
Reality sucks.

21
00:01:11,130 --> 00:01:12,353
What is this?

22
00:01:12,473 --> 00:01:15,675
Quiet. Hold out your right arm.

23
00:01:15,677 --> 00:01:17,103
No. No. It's not my time.

24
00:01:17,145 --> 00:01:18,444
I don't turn 18 for another month.

25
00:01:18,513 --> 00:01:19,279
Hold out your arm.

26
00:01:19,348 --> 00:01:20,758
On The Ark, every crime,

27
00:01:20,759 --> 00:01:23,223
no matter how small, is punishable by death

28
00:01:23,225 --> 00:01:24,451
- unless you're under 18.
- Your watch.

29
00:01:24,553 --> 00:01:26,066
No. It was my father's.

30
00:01:26,319 --> 00:01:27,405
- Take it off.
- No.

31
00:01:27,525 --> 00:01:28,771
- Hey!
- No.

32
00:01:35,501 --> 00:01:38,301
Juvenile offenders get put here... lockup.

33
00:01:38,487 --> 00:01:40,499
We call it the sky box.

34
00:01:42,136 --> 00:01:43,936
Prisoner 319...

35
00:01:43,938 --> 00:01:46,554
Clarke, stop. Wait here.

36
00:01:46,594 --> 00:01:50,273
Mom? Mom, what's going on?

37
00:01:50,655 --> 00:01:52,377
What is this?

38
00:01:52,379 --> 00:01:53,846
Come on. Let's go.

39
00:01:53,848 --> 00:01:54,765
They're killing us all, aren't they,

40
00:01:54,790 --> 00:01:57,583
reducing population to make
more time for the rest of you?

41
00:01:57,612 --> 00:01:59,812
Clarke, you are not being executed.

42
00:01:59,814 --> 00:02:01,847
You're being sent to the ground,

43
00:02:01,849 --> 00:02:03,182
all 100 of you.

44
00:02:03,184 --> 00:02:05,114
What? But it's not safe.

45
00:02:05,127 --> 00:02:05,852
No. No.

46
00:02:05,871 --> 00:02:07,453
We get reviewed at 18.

47
00:02:07,455 --> 00:02:08,921
The rules have changed.

48
00:02:08,923 --> 00:02:10,990
This gives you a chance to live.

49
00:02:12,115 --> 00:02:13,379
Your instincts will tell you

50
00:02:13,416 --> 00:02:15,644
to take care of everybody else first,

51
00:02:15,681 --> 00:02:18,215
just like your father, but be careful.

52
00:02:18,278 --> 00:02:21,570
I can't lose you, too. I love you so much.

53
00:02:27,510 --> 00:02:31,713
Earth, Clarke. You get to go to Earth.

55
00:03:01,281 --> 00:03:02,895
Welcome back.

56
00:03:03,560 --> 00:03:05,026
Look.

57
00:03:05,028 --> 00:03:07,256
Wells, why the hell are you here?

58
00:03:07,319 --> 00:03:09,434
When I found out they
were sending prisoners

59
00:03:09,453 --> 00:03:11,132
to the ground, I got myself arrested.

60
00:03:11,134 --> 00:03:13,201
I came for you.

61
00:03:16,106 --> 00:03:17,405
What was that?

62
00:03:17,497 --> 00:03:20,098
That was the atmosphere.

63
00:03:20,449 --> 00:03:22,801
Prisoners of The Ark, hear me now.

64
00:03:23,196 --> 00:03:25,570
You've been given a second chance,

65
00:03:25,572 --> 00:03:28,414
and as your Chancellor, it
is my hope that you see this

66
00:03:28,451 --> 00:03:31,676
as not just a chance for you,
but a chance for all of us,

67
00:03:31,678 --> 00:03:34,063
indeed for mankind itself.

68
00:03:34,125 --> 00:03:36,648
We have no idea what is
waiting for you down there.

69
00:03:36,768 --> 00:03:38,537
If the odds of survival were better,

70
00:03:38,562 --> 00:03:39,469
we would've sent others.

71
00:03:39,507 --> 00:03:41,847
Frankly, we're sending
you because your crimes

72
00:03:41,865 --> 00:03:43,767
have made you expendable.

73
00:03:43,835 --> 00:03:45,693
Your dad is a dick, Wells.

74
00:03:45,762 --> 00:03:47,670
Those crimes will be forgiven,

75
00:03:47,694 --> 00:03:49,894
your records wiped clean.

76
00:03:55,052 --> 00:03:57,468
I saw a ship launch not
more than 20 minutes ago.

77
00:03:57,936 --> 00:03:58,936
Who was on it?

78
00:03:58,938 --> 00:04:00,571
Was it the prisoners? They're just kids.

79
00:04:00,691 --> 00:04:02,144
Are they going to Earth?
Has something changed?

80
00:04:02,194 --> 00:04:03,808
Folks, as I said, at this time,

81
00:04:03,833 --> 00:04:06,110
we cannot confirm or deny anything.

82
00:04:06,148 --> 00:04:08,045
Come on, lady!

83
00:04:08,047 --> 00:04:10,514
My son is on that ship.

84
00:04:13,444 --> 00:04:15,219
The drop site has been chosen carefully.

85
00:04:15,221 --> 00:04:17,154
Before the last war, Mount Weather

86
00:04:17,156 --> 00:04:19,457
was a military base
built within a mountain.

87
00:04:19,577 --> 00:04:22,127
It was to be stocked with
enough non-perishables

88
00:04:22,171 --> 00:04:25,819
to sustain 300 people for up to two years.

89
00:04:25,869 --> 00:04:27,633
Spacewalk bandit strikes again.

90
00:04:28,401 --> 00:04:29,934
Go, Finn!

91
00:04:30,036 --> 00:04:32,069
Check it out.

92
00:04:33,101 --> 00:04:35,105
Your dad floated me, after all.

93
00:04:35,107 --> 00:04:37,875
You should strap in before
the parachutes deploy.

94
00:04:37,877 --> 00:04:40,611
Hey, you two, stay put if you want to live.

95
00:04:40,996 --> 00:04:42,613
Mount Weather is life.

96
00:04:42,615 --> 00:04:45,816
You must locate those supplies immediately.

97
00:04:45,818 --> 00:04:47,827
Hey, you're the traitor who's
been in solitary for a year.

98
00:04:47,877 --> 00:04:49,667
You're the idiot who
wasted a month of oxygen

99
00:04:49,698 --> 00:04:50,793
on an illegal spacewalk.

100
00:04:50,849 --> 00:04:52,482
But it was fun.

101
00:04:53,008 --> 00:04:54,247
I'm Finn.

102
00:04:54,259 --> 00:04:56,727
Your one responsibility is stay alive.

103
00:05:00,365 --> 00:05:02,900
Stay in your seats.

104
00:05:09,006 --> 00:05:11,508
Finn, are you ok?

105
00:05:15,713 --> 00:05:17,264
Not now.

106
00:05:17,616 --> 00:05:19,249
Total system failure,

107
00:05:19,251 --> 00:05:20,617
that's what we're looking at.

108
00:05:20,619 --> 00:05:22,344
All we know for sure is
that they were off course

109
00:05:22,387 --> 00:05:23,363
when we lost contact, so...

110
00:05:23,388 --> 00:05:24,677
Tell me about communications.

111
00:05:24,696 --> 00:05:25,922
Other than the telemetry
from their wristbands,

112
00:05:25,966 --> 00:05:27,505
we got nothing... no audio, no video,

113
00:05:27,558 --> 00:05:28,458
no computer link.

114
00:05:28,460 --> 00:05:29,793
Everything that we programmed in

115
00:05:29,820 --> 00:05:31,046
to help them is gone.

116
00:05:31,059 --> 00:05:33,017
They're on their own.

117
00:05:33,192 --> 00:05:35,465
Retrorockets ought to have fired by now.

118
00:05:36,067 --> 00:05:38,034
Ok. Everything on this ship
is 100 years old, right?

119
00:05:38,103 --> 00:05:39,241
Just give it a second.

120
00:05:39,298 --> 00:05:41,371
Clarke, there's something
I have to tell you.

121
00:05:41,491 --> 00:05:43,273
I'm sorry I got your father arrested.

122
00:05:43,275 --> 00:05:45,208
Don't you talk about my father.

123
00:05:45,210 --> 00:05:47,777
Please, I can't die
knowing that you hate me.

124
00:05:47,779 --> 00:05:49,727
They didn't arrest my father, Wells.

125
00:05:49,746 --> 00:05:52,215
They executed him. I do hate you.

126
00:06:14,125 --> 00:06:15,939
Listen.

127
00:06:16,696 --> 00:06:18,455
No machine hum.

128
00:06:19,878 --> 00:06:21,464
Whoa.

129
00:06:21,980 --> 00:06:23,579
That's a first.

130
00:06:30,645 --> 00:06:32,622
Finn, is he breathing?

131
00:06:35,632 --> 00:06:37,593
The outer door is on the lower level.

132
00:06:37,627 --> 00:06:38,691
- Let's go.
- No.

133
00:06:38,710 --> 00:06:40,543
We can't just open the doors.

134
00:06:42,670 --> 00:06:45,410
Hey, just back it up, guys.

135
00:06:46,004 --> 00:06:47,303
Stop.

136
00:06:50,073 --> 00:06:51,941
The air could be toxic.

137
00:06:51,943 --> 00:06:53,769
If the air is toxic,
we're all dead, anyway.

138
00:06:53,794 --> 00:06:55,227
Bellamy?

139
00:07:10,060 --> 00:07:13,177
My God, look how big you are.

140
00:07:18,768 --> 00:07:20,240
What the hell are you wearing,

141
00:07:20,259 --> 00:07:21,576
a guard's uniform?

142
00:07:21,579 --> 00:07:23,781
I borrowed it to get on the drop ship.

143
00:07:24,242 --> 00:07:26,475
Someone has got to keep an eye on you.

144
00:07:28,045 --> 00:07:29,645
Where's your wristband?

145
00:07:29,647 --> 00:07:31,046
Do you mind?

146
00:07:31,048 --> 00:07:32,489
I haven't seen my brother in a year.

147
00:07:32,533 --> 00:07:34,228
No one has a brother.

148
00:07:34,410 --> 00:07:35,833
That's Octavia Blake,

149
00:07:35,842 --> 00:07:37,957
the girl they found hidden in the floor.

150
00:07:38,551 --> 00:07:40,322
Octavia, Octavia, no.

151
00:07:40,324 --> 00:07:41,924
Let's give them something else

152
00:07:41,926 --> 00:07:43,192
to remember you by.

153
00:07:43,194 --> 00:07:44,563
Yeah? Like what?

154
00:07:44,683 --> 00:07:47,491
Like being the first person
on the ground in 100 years.

155
00:08:42,284 --> 00:08:44,567
We're back, bitches!

156
00:09:30,599 --> 00:09:32,732
Why so serious, princess?

157
00:09:33,303 --> 00:09:36,571
It's not like we died in a fiery explosion.

158
00:09:36,573 --> 00:09:38,257
Try telling that to the two guys

159
00:09:38,288 --> 00:09:40,516
who tried to follow you out of their seats.

160
00:09:43,345 --> 00:09:46,080
You don't like being called princess,

161
00:09:46,082 --> 00:09:47,615
do you, princess?

162
00:09:47,979 --> 00:09:49,750
Do you see that peak over there?

163
00:09:51,086 --> 00:09:52,408
Yeah.

164
00:09:52,822 --> 00:09:54,435
Mount Weather.

165
00:09:54,691 --> 00:09:56,418
There's a radiation-soaked forest

166
00:09:56,437 --> 00:09:58,495
between us and our next meal.

167
00:10:00,253 --> 00:10:02,750
They dropped us on the wrong damn mountain.

168
00:10:09,264 --> 00:10:10,931
There it is.

169
00:10:10,933 --> 00:10:13,467
We know they've landed,
but communications are down,

170
00:10:13,469 --> 00:10:14,768
which means we're still blind

171
00:10:14,787 --> 00:10:16,633
to conditions on the ground.

172
00:10:16,753 --> 00:10:18,272
Thanks to Abby's wristbands,

173
00:10:18,274 --> 00:10:20,006
at least we know how those conditions

174
00:10:20,018 --> 00:10:22,527
affect the human body, which is

175
00:10:23,022 --> 00:10:24,960
more than we've had for 100 years.

176
00:10:24,986 --> 00:10:26,562
So nice work.

177
00:10:26,582 --> 00:10:28,582
Now, what are they telling us?

178
00:10:29,422 --> 00:10:32,619
Two dead kids, dark tiles.

179
00:10:34,703 --> 00:10:36,836
Dr. Jackson, please share our theory

180
00:10:36,880 --> 00:10:38,192
with Councilor Kane.

181
00:10:38,194 --> 00:10:38,914
Of course.

182
00:10:38,951 --> 00:10:41,461
Granted, they've only been
on the ground for 7 minutes,

183
00:10:41,504 --> 00:10:43,806
but as of now, we believe the fatalities

184
00:10:43,863 --> 00:10:46,384
are due to the landing,
not radiation levels.

185
00:10:46,435 --> 00:10:48,230
Both boys died at the same time

186
00:10:48,255 --> 00:10:49,781
that we lost contact with the drop ship.

187
00:10:49,838 --> 00:10:52,372
- Rough landing? That's your theory?
- The dots connect.

188
00:10:52,416 --> 00:10:54,543
Would you agree that if it was radiation,

189
00:10:54,580 --> 00:10:56,977
we'd see fatalities
climb fairly quickly now?

190
00:10:56,979 --> 00:11:00,195
Because I'm noticing a
lot of red on that board.

191
00:11:00,205 --> 00:11:02,449
Spiking vital signs, two possibilities...

192
00:11:02,451 --> 00:11:04,818
one, injuries sustained during landing.

193
00:11:04,820 --> 00:11:06,201
And the other?

194
00:11:06,229 --> 00:11:08,257
They're excited to be there.

195
00:11:17,029 --> 00:11:18,665
We got problems.

196
00:11:18,667 --> 00:11:20,667
The communications system is dead.

197
00:11:20,669 --> 00:11:21,546
I went to the roof.

198
00:11:21,615 --> 00:11:22,672
A dozen panels are missing.

199
00:11:22,691 --> 00:11:24,093
Heat fried the wires.

200
00:11:24,213 --> 00:11:26,773
Well, all that matters right
now is getting to Mount Weather.

201
00:11:26,808 --> 00:11:27,672
See? Look.

202
00:11:27,697 --> 00:11:29,075
This is us.

203
00:11:29,077 --> 00:11:32,612
This is where we need to
get to if we want to survive.

204
00:11:32,614 --> 00:11:34,581
Where'd you learn to do that?

205
00:11:36,555 --> 00:11:38,345
Your father.

206
00:11:38,908 --> 00:11:41,254
Ah, cool, a map.

207
00:11:41,256 --> 00:11:43,218
They got a bar in this
town? I'll buy you a beer.

208
00:11:43,262 --> 00:11:44,194
You mind?

209
00:11:44,206 --> 00:11:45,933
Hey, hey, hey,

210
00:11:46,234 --> 00:11:48,261
hands off of him. He's with us.

211
00:11:49,364 --> 00:11:51,097
Relax.

212
00:11:51,099 --> 00:11:52,603
We're just trying to
figure out where we are.

213
00:11:52,628 --> 00:11:55,068
We're on the ground. That
not good enough for you?

214
00:11:56,604 --> 00:11:58,853
We need to find Mount Weather.

215
00:11:58,973 --> 00:12:00,436
You heard my father's message.

216
00:12:00,455 --> 00:12:01,756
That has to be our first priority.

217
00:12:01,781 --> 00:12:03,609
Screw your father.

218
00:12:03,611 --> 00:12:06,045
What, you think you're in charge here,

219
00:12:06,047 --> 00:12:08,495
you and your little princess?

220
00:12:08,526 --> 00:12:11,117
Do you think we care who's in charge?

221
00:12:11,379 --> 00:12:13,386
We need to get to Mount Weather

222
00:12:13,388 --> 00:12:15,020
not because the Chancellor said so,

223
00:12:15,039 --> 00:12:16,823
but because the longer we wait,

224
00:12:16,825 --> 00:12:19,425
the hungrier we'll get
and the harder this'll be.

225
00:12:19,427 --> 00:12:22,195
How long do you think we'll
last without those supplies?

226
00:12:22,527 --> 00:12:25,279
We're looking at a 20-mile trek, ok?

227
00:12:25,281 --> 00:12:27,019
So if we want to get there before dark,

228
00:12:27,045 --> 00:12:29,140
we need to leave now.

229
00:12:29,203 --> 00:12:30,447
I got a better idea.

230
00:12:30,510 --> 00:12:32,718
You two go, find it for us.

231
00:12:32,889 --> 00:12:35,156
Let the privileged do the
hard work for a change.

232
00:12:35,183 --> 00:12:36,757
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

233
00:12:36,759 --> 00:12:39,327
You're not listening. We all need to go.

234
00:12:39,329 --> 00:12:42,530
Look at this, everybody...
the Chancellor of Earth.

235
00:12:42,532 --> 00:12:44,332
Think that's funny?

236
00:12:44,334 --> 00:12:46,500
- Uh!
- Wells.

237
00:12:46,502 --> 00:12:47,802
Yeah. Come on. Get him.

238
00:12:48,437 --> 00:12:52,239
No, but that was. All right.

239
00:12:52,241 --> 00:12:55,042
What you gonna do now, Wells?

240
00:12:55,044 --> 00:12:57,511
Come on. Come on.

241
00:13:03,685 --> 00:13:05,586
Kid's got one leg.

242
00:13:06,310 --> 00:13:08,289
How about you wait until it's a fair fight?

243
00:13:10,058 --> 00:13:12,217
Hey, spacewalker,

244
00:13:13,631 --> 00:13:15,483
rescue me next.

245
00:13:24,172 --> 00:13:26,482
What? He's cute.

246
00:13:27,043 --> 00:13:28,121
He's a criminal.

247
00:13:28,152 --> 00:13:29,448
They're all criminals.

248
00:13:29,568 --> 00:13:32,446
Look, O. I came down here to protect you.

249
00:13:32,448 --> 00:13:33,947
I don't need protecting.

250
00:13:33,949 --> 00:13:35,642
I have been locked up one way

251
00:13:35,667 --> 00:13:36,556
or another all my life.

252
00:13:36,606 --> 00:13:38,920
I am done following orders.

253
00:13:39,588 --> 00:13:41,288
I need to have fun, Bell.

254
00:13:41,290 --> 00:13:43,056
I need to just do something crazy

255
00:13:43,081 --> 00:13:44,892
just because I can, and no one,

256
00:13:45,089 --> 00:13:47,060
including you, is gonna stop me.

257
00:13:47,062 --> 00:13:48,493
I can't stay with them, O.

258
00:13:48,530 --> 00:13:50,206
Now what are you talking about?

259
00:13:50,326 --> 00:13:51,820
Go find something.

260
00:13:52,596 --> 00:13:55,793
I did something, ok,
to get on the drop ship,

261
00:13:55,812 --> 00:13:57,626
something that they will kill me for

262
00:13:57,651 --> 00:13:58,554
when they come down.

263
00:13:58,595 --> 00:14:00,240
I can't say what it is just yet,

264
00:14:00,266 --> 00:14:02,143
but you have to trust me.

265
00:14:02,444 --> 00:14:04,902
You do still trust me, don't you?

266
00:14:05,681 --> 00:14:07,013
Yeah.

267
00:14:09,545 --> 00:14:12,667
So Mount Weather. When do we leave?

268
00:14:13,355 --> 00:14:15,222
Right now.

269
00:14:15,539 --> 00:14:17,724
We'll be back tomorrow with food.

270
00:14:18,361 --> 00:14:20,019
How are the two of you gonna carry

271
00:14:20,061 --> 00:14:21,232
enough food for 100?

272
00:14:25,495 --> 00:14:27,983
4 of us. Can we go now?

273
00:14:28,103 --> 00:14:30,237
Sounds like a party. Make it 5.

274
00:14:30,274 --> 00:14:31,751
Hey, what the hell are you doing?

275
00:14:31,871 --> 00:14:33,306
- Going for a walk.
- Hey,

276
00:14:34,704 --> 00:14:36,131
were you trying to take this off?

277
00:14:36,178 --> 00:14:37,908
Yeah. So?

278
00:14:37,913 --> 00:14:39,560
So this wristband transmits

279
00:14:39,566 --> 00:14:41,243
your vital signs to The Ark.

280
00:14:41,512 --> 00:14:43,149
Take it off, and they'll think you're dead.

281
00:14:43,182 --> 00:14:43,952
Should I care?

282
00:14:43,983 --> 00:14:44,846
Well, I don't know.

283
00:14:44,884 --> 00:14:47,099
Do you want the people you
love to think you're dead?

284
00:14:47,219 --> 00:14:49,138
Do you want them to follow
you down here in two months?

285
00:14:49,169 --> 00:14:51,660
Because they won't if
they think we're dying.

286
00:14:55,763 --> 00:14:56,539
Ok.

287
00:14:57,365 --> 00:14:59,029
Now let's go.

288
00:15:04,738 --> 00:15:06,205
Go on.

289
00:15:12,837 --> 00:15:15,127
You shouldn't have come here, Wells.

290
00:15:26,981 --> 00:15:30,612
Before you get any ideas, Finn is mine.

291
00:15:30,732 --> 00:15:33,699
Before you get any ideas, I don't care.

292
00:15:35,840 --> 00:15:38,419
Hey, darling, how's Clarke?

293
00:15:39,306 --> 00:15:41,132
Her vital signs are strong,

294
00:15:41,164 --> 00:15:42,508
blood sugar is low.

295
00:15:42,534 --> 00:15:43,409
She hasn't eaten.

296
00:15:45,631 --> 00:15:48,065
This is Dr. Griffin.

297
00:15:49,260 --> 00:15:50,382
On my way.

298
00:15:50,624 --> 00:15:53,166
Jackson, put it out there we need blood...

299
00:15:53,190 --> 00:15:54,472
"A" neg. And a lot of it...

300
00:15:54,510 --> 00:15:55,586
and then get your ass to the O.R.

301
00:15:55,605 --> 00:15:57,472
Abby, what's wrong?

302
00:15:57,592 --> 00:15:59,458
The Chancellor has been shot.

303
00:16:12,377 --> 00:16:15,207
Now, that, my friend, is game.

304
00:16:15,209 --> 00:16:17,643
That, my friend, is poison sumac.

305
00:16:17,677 --> 00:16:19,211
What? It is?

306
00:16:19,213 --> 00:16:20,813
The flowers aren't poisonous.

307
00:16:20,815 --> 00:16:22,948
They're medicinal, calming, actually.

308
00:16:23,301 --> 00:16:25,884
His family grows all the
pharmaceuticals on The Ark.

309
00:16:25,886 --> 00:16:28,088
Hey, guys, would you try to keep up?

310
00:16:28,119 --> 00:16:30,389
Come on, Clarke. How do
you block all this out?

311
00:16:30,759 --> 00:16:32,257
Well, it's simple.

312
00:16:32,442 --> 00:16:34,970
I wonder, "why haven't
we seen any animals?"

313
00:16:35,090 --> 00:16:36,628
Maybe it's because there are none.

314
00:16:36,630 --> 00:16:38,561
Maybe we've already been exposed

315
00:16:38,573 --> 00:16:40,362
to enough radiation to kill us.

316
00:16:40,801 --> 00:16:43,528
Sure is pretty, though. Come on.

317
00:16:44,305 --> 00:16:46,738
Someone should slip her some poison sumac.

318
00:16:51,543 --> 00:16:53,839
I got to know what you
two did to get busted.

319
00:16:54,381 --> 00:16:56,882
Sumac is not the only herb in the garden,

320
00:16:56,918 --> 00:16:57,794
if you know what I mean.

321
00:16:57,837 --> 00:16:59,295
Someone forget to replace what we took.

322
00:16:59,314 --> 00:17:01,419
Someone has apologized, like, 1,000 times.

323
00:17:01,441 --> 00:17:04,094
How about you, Octavia?
What'd they get you for?

324
00:17:06,159 --> 00:17:08,154
Being born.

325
00:17:09,329 --> 00:17:12,264
That is so not game.

326
00:17:23,042 --> 00:17:25,194
No animals, huh?

327
00:17:46,760 --> 00:17:48,830
Chancellor has lost a lot of blood.

328
00:17:49,843 --> 00:17:52,196
If only they found him sooner, damn it.

329
00:17:52,240 --> 00:17:53,372
He's waking up.

330
00:17:54,492 --> 00:17:56,035
Increase the anesthesia.

331
00:17:56,456 --> 00:17:58,504
We used way too much blood and anesthesia.

332
00:17:58,624 --> 00:18:00,298
We're way over the line.

333
00:18:00,418 --> 00:18:02,408
Your Chancellor is going into shock.

334
00:18:02,410 --> 00:18:04,027
You're asking me to break the law.

335
00:18:04,045 --> 00:18:05,328
Fine. I'll do it myself.

336
00:18:05,448 --> 00:18:07,480
Let them come after me.

337
00:18:07,482 --> 00:18:08,748
Excuse me, sir.

338
00:18:08,750 --> 00:18:10,690
You asked to be notified if there was news.

339
00:18:10,715 --> 00:18:12,418
The Chancellor is still in surgery,

340
00:18:12,420 --> 00:18:14,453
but we have I.D.ed the shooter.

341
00:18:14,487 --> 00:18:15,820
Bellamy Blake is the only person

342
00:18:15,857 --> 00:18:16,927
on The Ark unaccounted for.

343
00:18:16,965 --> 00:18:17,497
Who is he?

344
00:18:17,540 --> 00:18:19,248
He's no one, a janitor.

345
00:18:19,267 --> 00:18:20,418
We're still working up a profile,

346
00:18:20,437 --> 00:18:22,120
but his motive for going to Earth is clear.

347
00:18:22,240 --> 00:18:24,930
Sister. I remember.

348
00:18:25,698 --> 00:18:27,988
Her mother kept her
hidden for almost 16 years,

349
00:18:27,988 --> 00:18:29,884
nearly a record.

350
00:18:30,656 --> 00:18:32,545
What is it, Commander Shumway. Spit it out.

351
00:18:32,570 --> 00:18:33,734
We could start now.

352
00:18:33,854 --> 00:18:35,548
As Chancellor pro tempore,

353
00:18:35,611 --> 00:18:36,749
you can give the order

354
00:18:36,793 --> 00:18:39,371
to start reducing the population.

355
00:18:41,649 --> 00:18:43,115
Not yet.

356
00:18:43,117 --> 00:18:44,966
Sir, we're wasting time.

357
00:18:45,086 --> 00:18:47,548
Removing the 100 from the population

358
00:18:47,592 --> 00:18:48,968
only buys us another month.

359
00:18:49,018 --> 00:18:52,114
Engineering needs more than
that to fix those systems,

360
00:18:52,133 --> 00:18:53,403
if they can fix them at all.

361
00:18:53,409 --> 00:18:56,087
You have my answer, Commander. Enough.

362
00:18:56,864 --> 00:18:59,331
If we're gonna kill
hundreds of innocent people,

363
00:18:59,333 --> 00:19:02,034
we're gonna do it by the book.

364
00:19:02,036 --> 00:19:03,582
Is that clear?

365
00:19:03,702 --> 00:19:05,935
In the meantime, I want to know who helped

366
00:19:05,966 --> 00:19:07,987
this janitor get on that drop ship

367
00:19:08,025 --> 00:19:11,310
because he sure as hell
didn't do it by himself.

368
00:19:11,312 --> 00:19:14,146
Seems we have a traitor
in our midst, Commander,

369
00:19:14,148 --> 00:19:17,716
and the 100 have an assassin in theirs.

370
00:19:23,748 --> 00:19:25,157
Find any water yet?

371
00:19:25,159 --> 00:19:27,345
No, not yet, but...

372
00:19:28,562 --> 00:19:30,586
I'm going back out if you want to come.

373
00:19:38,806 --> 00:19:41,907
You know, my father, he begged for mercy

374
00:19:41,909 --> 00:19:44,876
in the airlock chamber when
your father floated him.

375
00:19:47,914 --> 00:19:51,049
You spelled "die" wrong, geniuses.

376
00:19:54,554 --> 00:19:56,121
If you're gonna kill someone,

377
00:19:56,123 --> 00:19:58,123
it's probably best not to announce it.

378
00:19:59,626 --> 00:20:01,488
You're not really a member
of the guard, are you?

379
00:20:01,506 --> 00:20:04,896
No. The real guard will be
here soon unless we stop it.

380
00:20:05,505 --> 00:20:08,264
You don't actually think they're
gonna forgive your crimes.

381
00:20:09,540 --> 00:20:11,870
Even if they do, then what?

382
00:20:12,099 --> 00:20:15,039
Guys like us, we're gonna
become model citizens now,

383
00:20:15,041 --> 00:20:17,998
get jobs, if we're lucky,

384
00:20:18,254 --> 00:20:20,684
- maybe pick up their trash?
- You got a point?

385
00:20:20,914 --> 00:20:22,914
No. I got a question.

386
00:20:22,916 --> 00:20:25,634
They locked you up, dumped you down here

387
00:20:25,659 --> 00:20:27,585
like lab rats to die.

388
00:20:27,587 --> 00:20:28,693
So why are you helping them?

389
00:20:28,724 --> 00:20:29,694
The hell we are.

390
00:20:29,738 --> 00:20:31,308
You're wearing those bracelets, aren't you?

391
00:20:31,333 --> 00:20:32,991
Right now, those things are telling them

392
00:20:32,997 --> 00:20:34,518
whether or not it's safe to follow us down.

393
00:20:34,562 --> 00:20:37,315
Ok. You said we could stop it. How?

394
00:20:37,631 --> 00:20:39,797
Take them off.

395
00:20:39,799 --> 00:20:41,432
The Ark will think you're dead,

396
00:20:41,794 --> 00:20:43,363
that it's not safe to follow.

397
00:20:43,483 --> 00:20:45,561
You follow?

398
00:20:46,236 --> 00:20:48,773
Right, and if we do,

399
00:20:48,775 --> 00:20:51,609
I mean, what's in it for us?

400
00:20:51,611 --> 00:20:53,587
Someone has got to help me run things.

401
00:20:57,950 --> 00:21:00,585
Hey, Ab. How's the Chancellor doing?

402
00:21:00,587 --> 00:21:03,387
Ask me again if he makes
it through the night.

403
00:21:03,404 --> 00:21:04,537
Who else did we lose?

404
00:21:04,581 --> 00:21:08,297
Murphy and Mbege, both named John.

405
00:21:08,328 --> 00:21:10,061
Neither was injured during landing.

406
00:21:10,111 --> 00:21:12,178
I concur. Something else killed these two.

407
00:21:12,214 --> 00:21:13,547
One second, they were fine,

408
00:21:13,565 --> 00:21:15,698
- and the next, bang.
- Then it isn't radiation.

409
00:21:15,761 --> 00:21:16,931
Come on, Abby.

410
00:21:17,051 --> 00:21:18,836
Wishful thinking isn't good science.

411
00:21:18,838 --> 00:21:20,438
It's not wishful thinking.

412
00:21:20,440 --> 00:21:22,092
One second, fine, the next, bang

413
00:21:22,130 --> 00:21:24,075
isn't how exposure to radiation presents.

414
00:21:24,851 --> 00:21:27,445
Well, it could be if
there was enough of it.

415
00:21:27,917 --> 00:21:29,437
If there was enough of it,

416
00:21:29,468 --> 00:21:31,157
they would all be dead.

417
00:21:37,496 --> 00:21:39,698
Please let me be right.

418
00:21:47,565 --> 00:21:49,679
Hey, you know what I'd like to know?

419
00:21:49,855 --> 00:21:52,569
Why send us down today after 97 years?

420
00:21:52,933 --> 00:21:54,038
What changed?

421
00:21:54,040 --> 00:21:56,340
Who cares? I'm just glad they did.

422
00:21:56,342 --> 00:21:58,276
I woke up rotting in a cell,

423
00:21:58,295 --> 00:22:01,211
and now I'm spinning in a forest.

424
00:22:01,213 --> 00:22:03,113
Maybe they found something on a satellite,

425
00:22:03,233 --> 00:22:05,584
you know, like an old
weather satellite or...

426
00:22:05,584 --> 00:22:07,160
It wasn't a satellite.

427
00:22:07,367 --> 00:22:09,219
The Ark is dying.

428
00:22:10,864 --> 00:22:13,891
At the current population level,
there's roughly 3 months left

429
00:22:13,893 --> 00:22:16,194
of life support, maybe
4 now that we're gone.

430
00:22:16,726 --> 00:22:19,251
So that was the secret
they locked you up to keep,

431
00:22:19,465 --> 00:22:21,131
why the kept you in solitary,

432
00:22:21,166 --> 00:22:22,899
floated your old man?

433
00:22:23,713 --> 00:22:27,237
My father was the engineer
who discovered the flaw.

434
00:22:27,667 --> 00:22:29,745
He thought the people had a right to know.

435
00:22:30,301 --> 00:22:33,577
The council disagreed. My mother disagreed.

436
00:22:33,579 --> 00:22:36,079
They were afraid it would cause a panic.

437
00:22:36,840 --> 00:22:39,412
We were gonna go public,
anyway, when Wells...

438
00:22:39,624 --> 00:22:41,939
What, turned in your dad?

439
00:22:42,321 --> 00:22:45,422
Anyway, the guard showed
up before we could.

440
00:22:46,068 --> 00:22:48,024
That's why today.

441
00:22:48,026 --> 00:22:49,634
That's why it was worth the risk.

442
00:22:49,809 --> 00:22:51,962
Even if we all die, at least

443
00:22:51,967 --> 00:22:53,294
they bought themselves more time.

444
00:22:53,337 --> 00:22:56,460
They're gonna kill more
people, aren't they?

445
00:22:57,105 --> 00:22:59,769
Good. After what they did to me,

446
00:22:59,771 --> 00:23:01,260
I say, float them all.

447
00:23:01,278 --> 00:23:02,805
You don't mean that.

448
00:23:05,042 --> 00:23:06,953
We have to warn them.

449
00:23:07,879 --> 00:23:10,246
That's what my father said.

450
00:23:14,836 --> 00:23:18,540
Oh, damn, I love Earth.

451
00:23:20,598 --> 00:23:23,675
Oh! Holy...

452
00:23:28,586 --> 00:23:30,800
Octavia, what the hell are you doing?

453
00:23:41,323 --> 00:23:42,824
Octavia...

454
00:23:43,675 --> 00:23:45,314
I can't swim.

455
00:23:45,316 --> 00:23:47,767
I know, but we can stand. Ha ha ha!

456
00:23:49,112 --> 00:23:51,596
Wait. There's not supposed
to be a river here.

457
00:23:51,615 --> 00:23:52,672
Well, there is.

458
00:23:52,716 --> 00:23:55,287
So take off your damn clothes.

459
00:24:09,906 --> 00:24:11,774
Octavia, get out of the water.

460
00:24:16,747 --> 00:24:18,848
Get out of the water now!

461
00:24:20,451 --> 00:24:22,651
Octavia!

462
00:24:25,990 --> 00:24:28,390
No.

463
00:24:42,706 --> 00:24:45,069
What the hell is that? We have to help her.

464
00:24:45,189 --> 00:24:46,714
- What are you gonna do?
- Try not to get eaten.

465
00:24:46,758 --> 00:24:47,540
No. Wait.

466
00:24:47,571 --> 00:24:50,187
If we distract it, it
might let her go. Help me.

467
00:24:50,980 --> 00:24:52,848
No!

468
00:24:57,186 --> 00:24:59,022
It worked. It let her go.

469
00:24:59,523 --> 00:25:01,143
Can you get to the shore now?

470
00:25:04,894 --> 00:25:06,918
I got you.

471
00:25:09,063 --> 00:25:10,509
It's coming back.

472
00:25:10,629 --> 00:25:12,736
It's headed right for you, guys.

473
00:25:14,056 --> 00:25:17,428
Come on. Come on. Keep going.

474
00:25:26,549 --> 00:25:27,782
Ok.

475
00:25:29,392 --> 00:25:31,638
Thank you. Thank you.

476
00:25:31,670 --> 00:25:32,965
You're gonna be ok.

477
00:25:33,085 --> 00:25:34,466
Note to self...

478
00:25:34,491 --> 00:25:36,762
next time, save the girl.

479
00:25:58,690 --> 00:26:01,224
Yeah. Go on, baby.

480
00:26:01,261 --> 00:26:03,851
Yeah. Keep going.

481
00:26:11,193 --> 00:26:12,085
Who's next?

482
00:26:12,205 --> 00:26:14,475
What the hell are you doing?

483
00:26:15,163 --> 00:26:17,221
We're liberating ourselves.

484
00:26:17,240 --> 00:26:18,428
What does it look like?

485
00:26:18,478 --> 00:26:20,962
It looks like you're
trying to get us all killed.

486
00:26:21,082 --> 00:26:23,214
The communication system is dead.

487
00:26:23,334 --> 00:26:25,480
These wristbands are all we got.

488
00:26:25,511 --> 00:26:27,588
Take them off, and The
Ark will think we're dying,

489
00:26:27,638 --> 00:26:29,178
that it's not safe for them to follow.

490
00:26:29,190 --> 00:26:31,535
That's the point, Chancellor.

491
00:26:31,655 --> 00:26:34,364
We can take care of ourselves, can't we?

492
00:26:34,389 --> 00:26:35,822
Yeah!

493
00:26:36,410 --> 00:26:37,586
You think this is a game?

494
00:26:37,623 --> 00:26:41,022
Those aren't just our friends
and our parents up there.

495
00:26:41,142 --> 00:26:44,593
They're our farmers, our
doctors, our engineers.

496
00:26:44,595 --> 00:26:46,528
I don't care what he tells you.

497
00:26:46,648 --> 00:26:49,586
We won't survive here on our own...

498
00:26:51,782 --> 00:26:54,109
and besides, if it really is safe,

499
00:26:54,153 --> 00:26:55,361
how could you not want the rest

500
00:26:55,398 --> 00:26:56,606
of our people to come down?

501
00:26:56,643 --> 00:26:58,802
My people already are down.

502
00:26:58,814 --> 00:27:01,792
Those people locked my people up.

503
00:27:01,912 --> 00:27:04,933
Those people killed my mother for the crime

504
00:27:04,965 --> 00:27:07,054
of having a second child.

505
00:27:07,636 --> 00:27:09,194
Your father did that.

506
00:27:09,219 --> 00:27:11,190
- My father didn't write the laws.
- No.

507
00:27:11,310 --> 00:27:12,748
He enforced them,

508
00:27:13,693 --> 00:27:15,107
but not anymore,

509
00:27:15,507 --> 00:27:17,378
not here.

510
00:27:17,416 --> 00:27:19,761
Here, there are no laws.

511
00:27:19,881 --> 00:27:21,463
- Yeah. Yeah.
- Cool.

512
00:27:21,465 --> 00:27:23,058
Here, we do whatever the hell we want

513
00:27:23,062 --> 00:27:25,408
whenever the hell we want.

514
00:27:25,796 --> 00:27:27,829
Now, you don't have to like it, Wells.

515
00:27:28,029 --> 00:27:30,507
You can even try to stop it or change it,

516
00:27:30,889 --> 00:27:32,384
kill me.

517
00:27:32,603 --> 00:27:34,780
You know why?

518
00:27:35,612 --> 00:27:37,402
Whatever the hell we want.

519
00:27:37,420 --> 00:27:39,222
Whatever the hell we want!

520
00:27:39,482 --> 00:27:41,315
Whatever the hell we want!

521
00:27:41,317 --> 00:27:42,933
♪ whatever the hell we want ♪

00:27:42,970 --> 00:27:44,309

530

Rain! Real rain!

531
00:28:02,970 --> 00:28:05,208
Check it out!

532
00:28:05,408 --> 00:28:06,779
It's water!

533
00:28:06,899 --> 00:28:08,943
We need to collect this.

534
00:28:08,945 --> 00:28:10,511
Whatever the hell you want.

535
00:28:31,282 --> 00:28:33,772
10 more, one after the next.

536
00:28:33,892 --> 00:28:36,988
Abby, look at plasma osmolarity.

537
00:28:37,026 --> 00:28:38,433
It's going up across the board.

538
00:28:38,477 --> 00:28:40,755
They found water.

539
00:28:42,889 --> 00:28:45,189
Councilor Abigail Griffin,
you're under arrest

540
00:28:45,191 --> 00:28:48,663
for exceeding the maximum medical
supplies allowed for a patient.

541
00:28:50,490 --> 00:28:52,298
Sorry this has to be public.

542
00:28:52,418 --> 00:28:54,999
The policy in these
matters is very clear...

543
00:28:55,119 --> 00:28:57,385
no special treatment.

544
00:28:57,860 --> 00:29:00,126
- How much blood did you use, Abby?
- Don't answer that.

545
00:29:00,145 --> 00:29:01,478
I used whatever it took.

546
00:29:01,598 --> 00:29:03,855
Breaking the law to keep
you from becoming Chancellor

547
00:29:03,887 --> 00:29:06,239
was the easiest decision I've ever made.

548
00:29:07,221 --> 00:29:09,304
In that case,

549
00:29:09,648 --> 00:29:11,708
given your confession,

550
00:29:11,828 --> 00:29:14,166
in my role as Chancellor pro tempore,

551
00:29:14,166 --> 00:29:16,137
you leave me no choice
but to find you guilty.

552
00:29:16,162 --> 00:29:17,883
We always have a choice, Kane.

553
00:29:17,889 --> 00:29:20,899
You chose to press
charges against my husband,

554
00:29:20,955 --> 00:29:22,888
your friend, even though you knew

555
00:29:22,913 --> 00:29:24,176
he would get floated for it.

556
00:29:24,176 --> 00:29:26,873
You chose to include my
daughter in those charges,

557
00:29:26,935 --> 00:29:28,593
and now you're choosing this.

558
00:29:28,713 --> 00:29:31,384
Hiding behind the law
absolves you of nothing.

559
00:29:31,659 --> 00:29:33,887
Be that as it may, in accordance

560
00:29:33,912 --> 00:29:35,826
with penal code one,

561
00:29:36,239 --> 00:29:37,790
because all crimes

562
00:29:38,491 --> 00:29:40,777
committed by those
above the age of maturity

563
00:29:40,779 --> 00:29:42,057
are capital crimes,

564
00:29:42,107 --> 00:29:44,322
you are hereby sentenced to death.

565
00:29:45,111 --> 00:29:47,495
Execution is set for the morning,

566
00:29:47,615 --> 00:29:50,960
and I choose at every turn

567
00:29:51,080 --> 00:29:53,437
and at any cost

568
00:29:53,713 --> 00:29:54,739
to make sure

569
00:29:54,760 --> 00:29:57,147
that the human race stays alive.

570
00:29:57,267 --> 00:30:00,119
That's the difference between us, Kane.

571
00:30:01,602 --> 00:30:03,003
I choose to make sure

572
00:30:03,028 --> 00:30:05,161
that we deserve to stay alive.

573
00:31:37,421 --> 00:31:39,195
Pretty cool, huh?

574
00:31:41,097 --> 00:31:42,961
Did you go to the river?

575
00:31:43,931 --> 00:31:46,377
Figured it was worth
losing a finger or two.

576
00:31:46,665 --> 00:31:47,804
Here.

577
00:31:52,728 --> 00:31:54,771
You call that a sip?

578
00:32:01,945 --> 00:32:03,273
You think this means we're all

579
00:32:03,298 --> 00:32:04,412
gonna grow two heads?

580
00:32:05,821 --> 00:32:08,679
What do you know? She can laugh.

581
00:32:10,331 --> 00:32:13,227
Come on. You have to see this.

582
00:32:25,144 --> 00:32:27,015
That's a toe.

583
00:32:27,290 --> 00:32:28,979
Plus, near as I can tell,

584
00:32:28,979 --> 00:32:31,600
whatever it is, it's walking on two feet.

585
00:32:31,720 --> 00:32:35,335
My Guess... monkeys.

586
00:32:37,656 --> 00:32:41,686
I'm sorry. It's just, according
to everything I've read,

587
00:32:41,688 --> 00:32:44,789
there were no bipedal
animals anywhere near here,

588
00:32:44,791 --> 00:32:46,220
certainly not monkeys.

589
00:32:46,233 --> 00:32:48,559
Right. You read anything about

590
00:32:48,561 --> 00:32:51,289
glow-in-the-dark forests
or man-eating snakes?

591
00:33:09,681 --> 00:33:11,712
Are you out of your mind?

592
00:33:11,739 --> 00:33:13,103
You can't just kill everyone

593
00:33:13,109 --> 00:33:14,315
who disagrees with you.

594
00:33:14,342 --> 00:33:15,731
Now, you all think I'm a bad guy,

595
00:33:16,876 --> 00:33:20,529
but I'm the only one who's willing to do

596
00:33:20,542 --> 00:33:23,114
what it takes to save us.

597
00:33:23,126 --> 00:33:24,258
She's my best friend.

598
00:33:24,271 --> 00:33:26,204
So what do you want me to say,

599
00:33:26,248 --> 00:33:27,849
I'm sorry?

600
00:33:28,749 --> 00:33:29,952
I'm not.

601
00:33:30,072 --> 00:33:32,566
Friendship is a luxury we can't afford,

602
00:33:32,686 --> 00:33:36,152
and if I have to take us
down to a cosmic Adam and Eve,

603
00:33:37,891 --> 00:33:39,887
I will do it.

604
00:33:40,094 --> 00:33:43,547
Please, show mercy,

605
00:33:44,365 --> 00:33:47,483
if not for Abby, then for me.

606
00:33:47,968 --> 00:33:50,369
We can't afford mercy, either.

607
00:34:09,989 --> 00:34:11,902
That's far enough.

608
00:34:12,022 --> 00:34:13,654
I don't want to shoot you, Wells...

609
00:34:13,774 --> 00:34:16,012
hell, I like you...

610
00:34:16,870 --> 00:34:18,127
but I do need them

611
00:34:18,165 --> 00:34:19,647
to think that you're dead.

612
00:34:19,691 --> 00:34:21,818
Why? Why are you doing this, for real,

613
00:34:21,824 --> 00:34:23,251
not some crap about getting to do

614
00:34:23,257 --> 00:34:24,895
what you want to do?

615
00:34:25,015 --> 00:34:27,872
I have my reasons. I also have the gun.

616
00:34:27,911 --> 00:34:30,241
So I ask the questions,

617
00:34:30,243 --> 00:34:31,289
and the question is,

618
00:34:31,409 --> 00:34:32,728
why aren't you helping me?

619
00:34:32,848 --> 00:34:35,212
You dad banished you, Wells, and yet

620
00:34:35,237 --> 00:34:37,482
here you are, still doing his bidding,

621
00:34:37,484 --> 00:34:38,966
following the rules.

622
00:34:39,016 --> 00:34:40,718
Aren't you tired of always doing

623
00:34:40,749 --> 00:34:41,825
what's expected of you?

624
00:34:41,876 --> 00:34:43,164
Stand up to him.

625
00:34:43,340 --> 00:34:45,620
Take off that wristband,
and you'll be amazed

626
00:34:45,623 --> 00:34:46,925
at how good it feels.

627
00:34:47,544 --> 00:34:48,664
No.

628
00:34:49,077 --> 00:34:50,791
Never. Not gonna happen.

629
00:34:50,835 --> 00:34:52,993
Is that clear enough for you?

630
00:34:54,701 --> 00:34:56,947
Yeah. It is.

631
00:34:58,371 --> 00:35:00,689
I'm sorry it had to be this way.

632
00:35:11,259 --> 00:35:14,757
No! No! Get off of me! No!

633
00:35:15,121 --> 00:35:16,754
Get him down. Put him down.

634
00:35:17,389 --> 00:35:19,791
No! Come on, man. Let me go.

635
00:35:19,793 --> 00:35:21,559
Get it. Do it.

636
00:35:21,561 --> 00:35:26,197
No! Don't do this! Don't do this! No. No!

637
00:35:26,199 --> 00:35:27,665
Come on, man. Aah!

638
00:35:42,291 --> 00:35:44,487
Dr. Griffin, it's time.

639
00:35:55,570 --> 00:35:57,150
Callie.

640
00:35:59,474 --> 00:36:01,192
That's enough.

641
00:36:01,517 --> 00:36:04,077
Watch out for Clarke for me.

642
00:36:04,079 --> 00:36:05,579
Ok.

643
00:36:43,617 --> 00:36:46,052
Jackson, use the wristbands.

644
00:36:46,054 --> 00:36:47,762
There may be a way to
reverse-engineer them

645
00:36:47,787 --> 00:36:48,845
for communication.

646
00:36:48,882 --> 00:36:52,104
Talk to Sinclair in engineering.
Nod if you understand.

647
00:37:01,617 --> 00:37:03,769
Stop.

648
00:37:07,473 --> 00:37:09,242
Dr. Griffin is pardoned.

649
00:37:17,416 --> 00:37:19,685
I'll deal with you later.

650
00:37:19,687 --> 00:37:21,454
Open the door.

651
00:37:22,891 --> 00:37:25,458
Open the door.

652
00:37:41,077 --> 00:37:45,219
I spent 12 hours putting
those intestines back together.

653
00:37:45,789 --> 00:37:48,447
Get him back to bed now.

654
00:37:51,513 --> 00:37:53,965
Tell me about the 100.

655
00:37:55,529 --> 00:37:56,889
Did they make it?

656
00:37:59,827 --> 00:38:02,895
You wanted to go first. Now quit stalling.

657
00:38:03,336 --> 00:38:04,930
Mount weather awaits.

658
00:38:04,932 --> 00:38:06,513
Just hang on till the apogee,

659
00:38:06,558 --> 00:38:07,466
and you'll be fine.

660
00:38:07,468 --> 00:38:10,356
The apogee like the Indians, right?

661
00:38:10,571 --> 00:38:13,205
Apogee, not apache.

662
00:38:13,207 --> 00:38:15,380
He knows. Today, Finn.

663
00:38:15,434 --> 00:38:19,177
Aye, aye, captain. See
you on the other side.

664
00:38:20,213 --> 00:38:23,081
- Wait.
- What?

665
00:38:23,083 --> 00:38:25,550
Let me.

666
00:38:26,653 --> 00:38:28,654
I can do it.

667
00:38:31,190 --> 00:38:33,358
Knew there was a badass in there somewhere.

668
00:38:43,844 --> 00:38:46,638
Hey, it's ok to be afraid, Jasper.

669
00:38:47,160 --> 00:38:48,707
The trick is not fighting it.

670
00:38:55,332 --> 00:38:58,383
See you on the other side. Ha ha!

671
00:39:03,089 --> 00:39:07,559
Whoo! Whoo! Whoo! Yeah!

672
00:39:19,506 --> 00:39:21,272
We are apogee!

673
00:39:21,274 --> 00:39:22,907
Yeah!

674
00:39:22,909 --> 00:39:24,375
Yeah!

675
00:39:24,377 --> 00:39:26,878
Yes! Whoo!

676
00:39:26,880 --> 00:39:29,380
Yeah! Whoo!

677
00:39:29,382 --> 00:39:31,215
You did it, Jasper!

678
00:39:31,217 --> 00:39:33,251
Whoo! Yeah!

679
00:39:36,787 --> 00:39:38,156
Let's go, princess.

680
00:39:38,158 --> 00:39:42,126
You're up.

681
00:39:42,128 --> 00:39:45,797
Come on, Clarke! You got this!

682
00:39:45,799 --> 00:39:48,566
Whoo! Apogee!

683
00:39:59,845 --> 00:40:02,480
We did it!

684
00:40:02,482 --> 00:40:07,952
Mount weather! Whoo! Whoo!

685
00:40:07,954 --> 00:40:09,553
Yes!

686
00:40:11,324 --> 00:40:13,924
Yeah, Jasper!

687
00:40:14,960 --> 00:40:17,228
Jasper.

688
00:40:17,230 --> 00:40:21,132
Come on. Come on. Come on. Jasper!

689
00:40:21,134 --> 00:40:24,034
Jasper! No. Come on.

690
00:40:24,036 --> 00:40:26,437
Get down. Get down.

691
00:40:26,439 --> 00:40:28,183
Come on.

692
00:40:35,062 --> 00:40:37,127
We're not alone.
