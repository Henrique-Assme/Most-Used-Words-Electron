1
00:00:00,852 --> 00:00:02,917
I was born in space.

2
00:00:02,964 --> 00:00:05,381
I've never felt the sun on my face

3
00:00:05,381 --> 00:00:07,031
or breathed real air,

4
00:00:07,070 --> 00:00:08,790
or floated in the water.

5
00:00:08,910 --> 00:00:10,315
None of us have.

6
00:00:10,347 --> 00:00:11,925
For 3 generations,

7
00:00:12,045 --> 00:00:15,147
The Ark has kept what's
left of the human race alive,

8
00:00:15,149 --> 00:00:18,050
but now our home is dying, and we

9
00:00:18,052 --> 00:00:20,386
are the last hope of mankind.

10
00:00:20,388 --> 00:00:24,156
100 prisoners sent on a
desperate mission to the ground.

11
00:00:24,158 --> 00:00:26,525
Each of us is here
because we broke the law.

12
00:00:26,527 --> 00:00:28,794
On the ground, there is no law.

13
00:00:28,796 --> 00:00:30,696
All we have to do is survive.

14
00:00:30,698 --> 00:00:32,197
But we will be tested,

15
00:00:32,199 --> 00:00:35,067
by the Earth, by the secrets it hides,

16
00:00:35,069 --> 00:00:37,369
and most of all, by each other.

17
00:00:39,239 --> 00:00:40,506
Previously on "The 100"...

18
00:00:40,508 --> 00:00:42,741
Prisoner 319, take off the watch.

19
00:00:42,743 --> 00:00:44,109
No. It was my father's.

20
00:00:44,111 --> 00:00:46,912
- Mom?
- You're being sent to the ground.

21
00:00:46,914 --> 00:00:49,515
Clarke, I'm sorry I got
your father arrested.

22
00:00:49,517 --> 00:00:50,949
They didn't arrest my father, Wells.

23
00:00:50,951 --> 00:00:52,851
They executed him.

24
00:00:52,853 --> 00:00:54,853
Atom, my sister doesn't leave this camp.

25
00:00:54,855 --> 00:00:57,522
Anyone who touches her, they answer to me.

26
00:00:57,524 --> 00:00:58,757
Atom.

27
00:01:01,160 --> 00:01:03,962
Jasper was hit. They took him.

28
00:01:05,898 --> 00:01:07,399
He's alive.

29
00:01:14,300 --> 00:01:15,017
_

30
00:01:15,020 --> 00:01:16,475
There we go. There we go.

31
00:01:18,444 --> 00:01:19,644
Feel that? Feel that?

32
00:01:19,646 --> 00:01:20,679
See that?

33
00:01:20,681 --> 00:01:21,947
Here comes the momentum change.

34
00:01:21,949 --> 00:01:23,415
Defense.

35
00:01:23,417 --> 00:01:24,382
The defense is there.

36
00:01:24,384 --> 00:01:27,719
- Serve it up.
- Yeah! Oh!

37
00:01:27,721 --> 00:01:30,188
- Yeah! Ho!
- Right here, kid.

38
00:01:30,190 --> 00:01:32,057
- They're unbeatable.
- Prepare for crushing defeat.

39
00:01:32,059 --> 00:01:33,191
It's not over yet.

40
00:01:33,193 --> 00:01:35,660
Actually, it was over 147 years ago.

41
00:01:35,662 --> 00:01:37,162
A technicality.

42
00:01:37,164 --> 00:01:39,331
Give it up. You're going down.

43
00:01:39,333 --> 00:01:40,632
What'd I miss?

44
00:01:40,634 --> 00:01:42,901
Your husband and daughter being obnoxious.

45
00:01:42,903 --> 00:01:44,102
Better play nice.

46
00:01:44,104 --> 00:01:45,403
Come on, get down the field, fire.

47
00:01:45,405 --> 00:01:47,405
Waste of time. Waste... hey, baby.

48
00:01:47,407 --> 00:01:48,873
Hi.

49
00:01:48,875 --> 00:01:51,342
So, I ran into Bennett when
I was leaving the clinic

50
00:01:51,344 --> 00:01:54,746
and he has that systems
analysis that you asked for.

51
00:01:57,184 --> 00:01:58,316
This isn't gonna last.

53
00:01:58,318 --> 00:01:59,951
What was that about momentum?

54
00:01:59,953 --> 00:02:01,619
Oh, oh, I feel the momentum.

55
00:02:01,621 --> 00:02:02,754
Ok.

56
00:02:03,589 --> 00:02:04,489
What? You're going now?

57
00:02:04,491 --> 00:02:05,990
Just for a few minutes.

58
00:02:07,026 --> 00:02:08,126
Everything ok?

59
00:02:08,128 --> 00:02:10,295
Oh, yeah. You know this old boat.

60
00:02:10,297 --> 00:02:11,996
It's always something.

61
00:02:15,802 --> 00:02:17,368
His pulse is thready.

62
00:02:20,373 --> 00:02:22,774
Go back to sleep!

63
00:02:22,776 --> 00:02:23,875
Quiet!

64
00:02:25,277 --> 00:02:26,577
Don't listen to them.

65
00:02:26,579 --> 00:02:28,279
You're gonna make it through this, ok?

66
00:02:28,281 --> 00:02:29,847
Promise.

67
00:02:29,849 --> 00:02:31,949
Can he just die already?

68
00:02:33,285 --> 00:02:34,652
I'm gonna get clean water.

69
00:02:34,654 --> 00:02:36,053
Keep an eye on him.

70
00:02:49,634 --> 00:02:50,901
No!

71
00:02:52,571 --> 00:02:53,704
No!

72
00:02:54,806 --> 00:02:56,474
No! No!

73
00:03:03,348 --> 00:03:07,484
Hey, wake up. It's ok. It's ok.

74
00:03:07,486 --> 00:03:09,653
It's just a dream.

75
00:03:09,655 --> 00:03:12,022
You're Charlotte, right?

76
00:03:12,024 --> 00:03:13,324
I'm Clarke.

77
00:03:15,126 --> 00:03:16,894
It's ok to be scared.

78
00:03:17,996 --> 00:03:19,697
Do you want to talk about it?

79
00:03:22,867 --> 00:03:27,237
It's... my parents.

80
00:03:29,841 --> 00:03:31,842
They were floated and they...

81
00:03:31,844 --> 00:03:34,411
and I see it in my dreams and I just...

82
00:03:34,413 --> 00:03:36,013
I understand.

83
00:03:37,415 --> 00:03:39,216
My dad was floated, too.

84
00:03:44,355 --> 00:03:46,123
So, how did you end up here?

85
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:53,697
Well... we were taking my parents' things

86
00:03:53,699 --> 00:03:56,700
to the redistribution center and...

87
00:03:56,702 --> 00:03:58,101
I kind of lost it.

88
00:04:00,505 --> 00:04:03,206
They said I assaulted a guard.

89
00:04:03,208 --> 00:04:05,142
I can't say I blame you.

90
00:04:14,185 --> 00:04:17,854
See that bright star up there?

91
00:04:17,856 --> 00:04:20,524
That's the Ark orbiting above us.

92
00:04:20,526 --> 00:04:23,526
I think whatever happened up there,

93
00:04:23,528 --> 00:04:25,562
you know, the pain...

94
00:04:27,198 --> 00:04:30,533
maybe we can move past that now.

95
00:04:30,535 --> 00:04:33,269
Maybe being on the ground

96
00:04:33,271 --> 00:04:34,838
is our second chance.

97
00:04:37,074 --> 00:04:39,075
Do you really believe that?

98
00:04:41,445 --> 00:04:42,846
I'm trying to.

99
00:05:10,074 --> 00:05:12,108
I think this is north. Come on.

100
00:05:12,110 --> 00:05:13,976
Really? Because we just came from that way,

101
00:05:13,978 --> 00:05:15,945
miss
I-can-navigate-with-the-stars.

102
00:05:15,947 --> 00:05:18,247
It's your fault we've
been lost for two days.

103
00:05:18,249 --> 00:05:19,882
Never should've gone off by ourselves.

104
00:05:19,884 --> 00:05:22,985
Come on. We'll find the dropship tomorrow.

105
00:05:22,987 --> 00:05:26,189
That's what you said last
night. And I'm hungry.

106
00:05:26,191 --> 00:05:28,524
Trina, relax. We're fine.

107
00:05:31,662 --> 00:05:32,862
Did you feel that?

108
00:05:35,565 --> 00:05:36,799
What is that?

109
00:05:36,801 --> 00:05:38,034
I don't know.

110
00:05:39,536 --> 00:05:40,670
I don't know.

111
00:05:45,308 --> 00:05:47,877
Oh! I can't see!

112
00:05:47,879 --> 00:05:49,011
Let's get out of here.

113
00:05:49,013 --> 00:05:51,213
Oh, my God, it burns! Aah!

114
00:05:51,215 --> 00:05:53,015
Aah!

115
00:06:03,694 --> 00:06:05,895
That damn kid, always messing with my head.

116
00:06:05,897 --> 00:06:07,463
He's not gonna last much longer.

117
00:06:07,465 --> 00:06:09,498
Better think of a new excuse.

118
00:06:09,500 --> 00:06:10,733
That's how it's done.

119
00:06:10,735 --> 00:06:12,468
We searched a half-mile all directions.

120
00:06:12,470 --> 00:06:15,004
No sign of Trina or Pascal.

121
00:06:15,006 --> 00:06:17,673
Visit your special tree
when you were out there?

122
00:06:17,675 --> 00:06:20,042
Atom took his punishment. Let it go.

123
00:06:20,044 --> 00:06:21,477
Could be grounders.

124
00:06:21,479 --> 00:06:24,580
Yeah, or they could be in pound town.

125
00:06:24,582 --> 00:06:26,582
Lot of that going around recently.

126
00:06:33,056 --> 00:06:35,357
Look, Bellamy, people are scared,

127
00:06:35,359 --> 00:06:37,059
and that dying kid,

128
00:06:37,061 --> 00:06:38,493
he's not helping the morale around here.

129
00:06:38,495 --> 00:06:40,195
Morale will go up when
I find them more food.

130
00:06:40,197 --> 00:06:42,030
And what do we say when they
ask about Trina and Pascal?

131
00:06:42,032 --> 00:06:45,667
Now? Nothing. It's
possible they're just lost.

132
00:06:45,669 --> 00:06:47,736
We'll keep an eye out for
them when we go hunting later.

133
00:06:47,738 --> 00:06:49,871
Let's go kill something.

134
00:06:49,873 --> 00:06:51,340
You're not going.

135
00:06:51,342 --> 00:06:52,874
I need you to stay here.

136
00:06:52,876 --> 00:06:54,342
If the grounders are circling,

137
00:06:54,344 --> 00:06:56,678
we can't leave this place unprotected.

138
00:06:56,680 --> 00:07:00,315
Fine. Somebody better tell
goggle boy to keep it shut.

139
00:07:13,062 --> 00:07:16,598
The grounders cauterized
the wound. Saved his life.

140
00:07:16,600 --> 00:07:19,434
Saved his life so they could
string him up for live bait.

141
00:07:20,803 --> 00:07:22,437
Garden of eden this ain't.

142
00:07:22,439 --> 00:07:25,874
This is infected. He could be septic.

143
00:07:25,876 --> 00:07:27,642
Any progress on using the wristbands

144
00:07:27,644 --> 00:07:29,577
to contact the Ark?

145
00:07:29,579 --> 00:07:30,779
Monty?

146
00:07:31,714 --> 00:07:33,415
That would be a firm no.

147
00:07:34,917 --> 00:07:36,017
My mother would know what to do.

148
00:07:36,019 --> 00:07:37,385
How's he doing?

149
00:07:37,387 --> 00:07:38,820
How does it look like he's doing, Wells?

150
00:07:38,822 --> 00:07:40,522
Hey, I'm just trying to help.

151
00:07:45,160 --> 00:07:46,628
Right. You want to help?

152
00:07:48,030 --> 00:07:49,163
Hold him down.

153
00:07:56,438 --> 00:07:58,373
I'm not gonna like this, am I?

154
00:08:04,980 --> 00:08:07,014
Hey.

155
00:08:07,016 --> 00:08:09,150
I could really use a break from this place.

156
00:08:09,152 --> 00:08:10,284
What do you say you and me

157
00:08:10,286 --> 00:08:12,553
take a trip to the butterfly field?

158
00:08:12,555 --> 00:08:13,721
Huh?

159
00:08:14,857 --> 00:08:16,457
Am I being too subtle?

160
00:08:18,161 --> 00:08:20,361
Atom.

161
00:08:26,568 --> 00:08:29,737
- With weapons...
- What did you do to Atom?

162
00:08:35,010 --> 00:08:36,177
Atom's fine.

163
00:08:36,179 --> 00:08:37,344
Then why did he blow me off?

164
00:08:37,346 --> 00:08:38,612
Maybe he's just not interested.

165
00:08:38,614 --> 00:08:40,815
You can't keep everyone away from me.

166
00:08:40,817 --> 00:08:41,882
Atom had to learn.

167
00:08:41,884 --> 00:08:43,317
You disobey me, you pay the price.

168
00:08:43,319 --> 00:08:44,885
He paid the price. Now we're good.

169
00:08:44,887 --> 00:08:46,487
Now I'm paying the price.

170
00:08:46,489 --> 00:08:48,989
So, next time you decide
to go on, a power trip,

171
00:08:48,991 --> 00:08:50,057
leave me out of it.

172
00:08:50,059 --> 00:08:51,592
Aah!

173
00:08:54,597 --> 00:08:56,363
Hold him still.

174
00:08:56,365 --> 00:08:58,565
I need to cut away the infected flesh.

175
00:09:02,370 --> 00:09:04,304
Stop it! You're killing him.

176
00:09:04,306 --> 00:09:05,606
She's trying to save his life.

177
00:09:05,608 --> 00:09:06,740
She can't.

178
00:09:08,877 --> 00:09:10,177
Back off.

179
00:09:10,179 --> 00:09:11,178
We didn't drag him through miles of woods

180
00:09:11,180 --> 00:09:12,112
just to let him die.

181
00:09:12,114 --> 00:09:13,514
Kid's a goner.

182
00:09:13,516 --> 00:09:15,015
If you can't see that, you're deluded.

183
00:09:15,017 --> 00:09:16,383
He's making people crazy.

184
00:09:16,385 --> 00:09:19,019
Sorry if Jasper's an inconvenience to you,

185
00:09:19,021 --> 00:09:20,587
but this isn't the Ark.

186
00:09:20,589 --> 00:09:22,256
Down here, every life matters.

187
00:09:22,258 --> 00:09:26,260
Take a look at him. He's a lost cause.

188
00:09:32,767 --> 00:09:34,534
Octavia, I've spent my whole life

189
00:09:34,536 --> 00:09:36,503
watching my mother heal people.

190
00:09:36,505 --> 00:09:38,105
If I say there's hope, there's hope.

191
00:09:38,107 --> 00:09:40,474
This isn't about hope, it's about guts.

192
00:09:40,476 --> 00:09:43,577
You don't have the guts to
make the hard choices. I do.

193
00:09:43,579 --> 00:09:45,612
He's been like this for 3 days.

194
00:09:45,614 --> 00:09:47,414
If he's not better by tomorrow,

195
00:09:47,416 --> 00:09:48,882
I'll kill him myself.

196
00:09:50,718 --> 00:09:52,886
Octavia, let's go.

197
00:09:54,722 --> 00:09:56,156
I'm staying here.

198
00:10:00,361 --> 00:10:02,929
Power-hungry,
self-serving jackass.

199
00:10:02,931 --> 00:10:04,898
He doesn't care about anyone but himself.

200
00:10:06,634 --> 00:10:07,767
No offense.

201
00:10:09,403 --> 00:10:13,640
Yeah. Bellamy is all that.

202
00:10:13,642 --> 00:10:15,475
But he also happens to be right.

203
00:10:31,925 --> 00:10:33,092
How'd it go?

204
00:10:34,728 --> 00:10:35,828
Hey.

205
00:10:37,598 --> 00:10:40,533
Well, I told Jaha it's definitive.

206
00:10:40,535 --> 00:10:43,769
The Ark's got a year of
oxygen left, maybe two.

207
00:10:43,771 --> 00:10:45,605
You'll fix it.

208
00:10:45,607 --> 00:10:47,473
Not this time.

209
00:10:47,475 --> 00:10:49,975
I've tried, Abby. This isn't a glitch.

210
00:10:51,311 --> 00:10:53,145
It's a system failure.

211
00:10:55,949 --> 00:10:57,183
People need to know.

212
00:10:57,185 --> 00:10:59,919
No. They'll panic.

213
00:10:59,921 --> 00:11:01,487
You sound like Kane.

214
00:11:01,489 --> 00:11:02,988
Because he's right.

215
00:11:02,990 --> 00:11:06,792
No. We can't avoid the truth.

216
00:11:06,794 --> 00:11:08,494
We have to let everyone on the Ark

217
00:11:08,496 --> 00:11:09,929
put their minds to a solution.

218
00:11:09,931 --> 00:11:11,130
What, and risk anarchy?

219
00:11:11,132 --> 00:11:12,698
No. It's too dangerous.

220
00:11:15,001 --> 00:11:17,603
Promise me that you'll
obey the council's orders,

221
00:11:17,605 --> 00:11:18,971
that you'll keep it quiet.

222
00:11:20,206 --> 00:11:21,640
Promise me.

223
00:11:28,181 --> 00:11:29,481
I can't.

224
00:11:33,253 --> 00:11:36,288
For Clarke. Do it for Clarke.

225
00:11:40,326 --> 00:11:42,294
I am doing this for Clarke.

226
00:11:49,335 --> 00:11:51,670
They'll float you, Jake.

227
00:11:51,672 --> 00:11:55,073
If you do this, I won't be able to stop it.

228
00:12:04,183 --> 00:12:05,317
You're mad.

229
00:12:06,919 --> 00:12:08,854
I'm not mad.

230
00:12:08,856 --> 00:12:11,022
You want to think Jasper's
a lost cause, go ahead.

231
00:12:11,024 --> 00:12:13,225
- You're wrong.
- I hope I am.

232
00:12:13,227 --> 00:12:16,394
Whatever this stuff is, it has to have had

233
00:12:16,396 --> 00:12:17,996
antibiotic properties.

234
00:12:19,732 --> 00:12:20,866
Let me take a look.

235
00:12:23,002 --> 00:12:24,569
Before you refuse my help, remember

236
00:12:24,571 --> 00:12:26,338
who aced botany in Earth skills.

237
00:12:28,307 --> 00:12:31,276
The grounders used it as a poultice.

238
00:12:31,278 --> 00:12:33,478
I'm thinking a tea might
be even more effective

239
00:12:33,480 --> 00:12:34,846
if we can figure out what it is.

240
00:12:34,848 --> 00:12:37,282
I know what it is. Seaweed.

241
00:12:37,284 --> 00:12:38,883
Look... no root structure.

242
00:12:38,885 --> 00:12:41,086
Right. Well, then there must
be a water source nearby.

243
00:12:41,088 --> 00:12:43,254
Yeah, it would have to have
a slow current, lots of rocks.

244
00:12:43,256 --> 00:12:44,522
The water would probably be

245
00:12:44,524 --> 00:12:45,690
more red than green.

246
00:12:45,692 --> 00:12:46,991
I know just the place.

247
00:12:46,993 --> 00:12:49,394
All right. Let's go.

248
00:12:51,230 --> 00:12:54,432
Hey. I know what this
stuff looks like. Do you?

249
00:12:58,871 --> 00:13:00,405
You know, you should, uh,

250
00:13:00,407 --> 00:13:03,408
really rethink this whole hating me thing.

251
00:13:03,410 --> 00:13:05,243
It's not just the grounders.

252
00:13:05,245 --> 00:13:06,911
We're surrounded by criminals.

253
00:13:06,913 --> 00:13:08,212
We need each other.

254
00:13:08,214 --> 00:13:09,747
We're gonna be friends again.

255
00:13:09,749 --> 00:13:14,252
You got my dad killed. Not possible.

256
00:13:14,254 --> 00:13:17,822
This is Earth, Clarke. Anything's possible.

257
00:13:22,828 --> 00:13:24,495
I'd let it go.

258
00:13:24,497 --> 00:13:26,631
Yeah.

259
00:13:26,633 --> 00:13:27,732
Well, I've known Clarke her whole life

260
00:13:27,734 --> 00:13:28,900
better than you ever will, so,

261
00:13:28,902 --> 00:13:30,034
I'll decide when to let it go.

262
00:13:30,036 --> 00:13:31,569
Yeah, I can tell you guys are close.

263
00:13:36,775 --> 00:13:37,942
What is it?

264
00:13:42,180 --> 00:13:43,481
Uhh.

265
00:13:44,416 --> 00:13:47,351
Ha! It's an automobile.

266
00:13:47,353 --> 00:13:49,553
Come on, guys. This
thing's been here 100 years.

267
00:13:49,555 --> 00:13:50,821
All right? It can wait.

268
00:13:50,823 --> 00:13:52,323
Jasper can't.

269
00:14:07,173 --> 00:14:10,207
Shh-shh-shh-shh.
She's mine.

270
00:14:15,814 --> 00:14:16,947
Get him.

271
00:14:19,651 --> 00:14:21,285
Who the hell are you?

272
00:14:21,287 --> 00:14:22,453
Charlotte.

273
00:14:22,455 --> 00:14:23,821
I almost killed you.

274
00:14:25,290 --> 00:14:26,924
Why aren't you back at camp?

275
00:14:26,926 --> 00:14:29,193
Well, what with that guy who was dying,

276
00:14:29,195 --> 00:14:31,328
I just... I couldn't listen anymore.

277
00:14:31,330 --> 00:14:32,629
There's grounders out here.

278
00:14:32,631 --> 00:14:34,231
It's too dangerous for a little girl.

279
00:14:34,233 --> 00:14:35,465
I'm not little.

280
00:14:39,370 --> 00:14:41,538
Ok, then...

281
00:14:41,540 --> 00:14:43,807
But you can't hunt without a weapon.

282
00:14:48,980 --> 00:14:50,514
Ever killed something before?

283
00:14:52,850 --> 00:14:55,519
Who knows? Maybe you're good at it.

284
00:15:02,493 --> 00:15:04,761
So, what does this seaweed look like?

285
00:15:08,766 --> 00:15:09,933
Like that.

286
00:15:09,935 --> 00:15:11,201
Hey, that thing that bit Octavia,

287
00:15:11,203 --> 00:15:12,168
how big was it?

288
00:15:12,170 --> 00:15:14,037
Big. We could rig this

289
00:15:14,039 --> 00:15:16,339
into some kind of a net.

290
00:15:16,341 --> 00:15:18,675
Find something to lower it into the water.

291
00:15:21,479 --> 00:15:22,746
Or we could just do that.

292
00:15:38,562 --> 00:15:39,896
Let's get out of here.

293
00:15:46,104 --> 00:15:47,070
Grounders?

294
00:15:47,072 --> 00:15:48,304
It could be a war cry

295
00:15:48,306 --> 00:15:49,439
or a warning.

296
00:15:56,046 --> 00:15:57,747
What the hell is that?

297
00:15:59,583 --> 00:16:01,117
Run. Run!

298
00:16:11,187 --> 00:16:12,354
Clarke.

299
00:16:13,856 --> 00:16:14,956
You're up.

300
00:16:16,425 --> 00:16:17,625
Clarke.

301
00:16:17,627 --> 00:16:18,960
Sorry.

302
00:16:23,265 --> 00:16:24,899
Well, if your strategy

303
00:16:24,901 --> 00:16:26,801
is to lose really fast,

304
00:16:26,803 --> 00:16:29,804
that was a great move.

305
00:16:29,806 --> 00:16:31,139
What's going on?

306
00:16:32,071 --> 00:16:33,204
Nothing.

307
00:16:35,174 --> 00:16:36,841
You can talk to me.

308
00:16:44,316 --> 00:16:47,485
My dad found a problem
with the oxygen system.

309
00:16:47,487 --> 00:16:48,720
I'm not supposed to know.

310
00:16:48,722 --> 00:16:50,054
They've had other malfunctions.

311
00:16:50,056 --> 00:16:51,389
They always figure out
a way to deal with it.

312
00:16:51,391 --> 00:16:53,358
No. This one might not be fixable.

313
00:16:56,395 --> 00:16:59,197
The council doesn't want anyone to know.

314
00:16:59,199 --> 00:17:01,365
The council meaning my dad?

315
00:17:01,367 --> 00:17:05,136
Yeah. And my mom and the others.

316
00:17:05,138 --> 00:17:07,004
I think he's gonna go public anyway.

317
00:17:07,006 --> 00:17:09,207
Clarke, he can't. He'll get floated.

318
00:17:09,209 --> 00:17:10,341
I know.

319
00:17:12,678 --> 00:17:14,111
But what if he's right?

320
00:17:16,048 --> 00:17:18,115
Don't people deserve to know the truth?

321
00:17:19,584 --> 00:17:21,118
You can't tell your dad I told you.

322
00:17:21,120 --> 00:17:22,853
You can't tell anyone.

323
00:17:22,855 --> 00:17:24,722
Your secret's safe with me.

324
00:17:25,724 --> 00:17:26,924
I promise.

325
00:17:29,161 --> 00:17:31,362
Clarke, run!

326
00:17:41,774 --> 00:17:43,440
It's getting inside.

327
00:17:43,442 --> 00:17:44,708
Seal any openings.

328
00:17:50,849 --> 00:17:52,716
Come on! There are caves this way.

329
00:18:08,567 --> 00:18:10,100
Bellamy!

330
00:18:11,569 --> 00:18:13,237
Bellamy!

331
00:18:18,276 --> 00:18:19,610
- What's going on?
- Air got thick,

332
00:18:19,612 --> 00:18:21,645
everybody's skin started burning.

333
00:18:21,647 --> 00:18:24,081
Monty, my brother's out there.

334
00:18:24,083 --> 00:18:26,850
He'll be fine. We'll all be fine.

335
00:18:33,858 --> 00:18:35,759
It's still out there.

336
00:18:35,761 --> 00:18:37,260
Look, we should just make a run for it.

337
00:18:37,262 --> 00:18:39,162
Jasper can't wait much longer.

338
00:18:39,164 --> 00:18:40,831
Us dying in a cloud of acid fog

339
00:18:40,833 --> 00:18:42,032
isn't gonna help Jasper.

340
00:18:46,904 --> 00:18:49,105
- Is that...
- Booze.

341
00:18:49,107 --> 00:18:52,175
Hooch. Rotgut.

342
00:18:59,984 --> 00:19:02,819
Well, careful. Finn, it could be...

343
00:19:02,821 --> 00:19:04,821
Whiskey, I think.

344
00:19:04,823 --> 00:19:06,556
Better than the moonshine on agro station.

345
00:19:07,992 --> 00:19:09,159
Alcohol's toxic.

346
00:19:09,161 --> 00:19:11,795
This is Earth. Everything's toxic.

347
00:19:11,797 --> 00:19:14,230
Plus, it's a time-honored rite of passage.

348
00:19:14,232 --> 00:19:15,365
We'll pass.

349
00:19:17,635 --> 00:19:19,903
Far be it from me to stand
in the way of tradition.

350
00:19:30,814 --> 00:19:32,081
No!

351
00:19:34,318 --> 00:19:36,185
Charlotte, wake up.

352
00:19:36,187 --> 00:19:37,587
I'm sorry.

353
00:19:39,156 --> 00:19:40,423
Does it happen often?

354
00:19:42,460 --> 00:19:43,993
What are you scared of?

355
00:19:46,029 --> 00:19:48,731
You know what? It doesn't matter.

356
00:19:50,134 --> 00:19:51,300
The only thing that matters is

357
00:19:51,302 --> 00:19:53,369
what you do about it.

358
00:19:53,371 --> 00:19:56,506
But... I'm asleep.

359
00:19:56,508 --> 00:19:59,075
Fears are fears.

360
00:19:59,077 --> 00:20:01,344
Slay your demons when you're awake,

361
00:20:01,346 --> 00:20:04,113
they won't be there to
get you when you sleep.

362
00:20:04,115 --> 00:20:07,350
Yeah, but... How?

363
00:20:07,352 --> 00:20:09,051
You can't afford to be weak.

364
00:20:09,053 --> 00:20:12,955
Down here, weakness is
death, fear is death.

365
00:20:19,062 --> 00:20:20,730
Let me see that knife I gave you.

366
00:20:25,335 --> 00:20:27,503
Now, when you feel afraid,

367
00:20:27,505 --> 00:20:28,771
you hold tight to that knife

368
00:20:28,773 --> 00:20:31,707
and you say, "screw you."

369
00:20:31,709 --> 00:20:33,042
"I'm not afraid."

370
00:20:38,248 --> 00:20:41,951
Screw you. I'm not afraid.

371
00:20:48,692 --> 00:20:52,294
Screw you. I'm not afraid.

372
00:20:54,164 --> 00:20:56,465
Slay your demons, kid.

373
00:20:56,467 --> 00:20:58,133
Then you'll be able to sleep.

374
00:21:02,639 --> 00:21:05,407
It's been hours. Jasper...

375
00:21:05,409 --> 00:21:06,775
Is in good hands.

376
00:21:06,777 --> 00:21:09,211
Octavia will take care of him.

377
00:21:09,213 --> 00:21:10,812
While we're on the subject,

378
00:21:10,814 --> 00:21:13,015
why is it that everyone

379
00:21:13,017 --> 00:21:17,753
thinks me wanting Jasper
to not die is a bad thing?

380
00:21:17,755 --> 00:21:21,823
Like I'm such a downer. I can be fun.

381
00:21:21,825 --> 00:21:24,893
Yeah. You think I'm fun. Right?

382
00:21:24,895 --> 00:21:26,962
Oh, yeah. Among other things.

383
00:21:26,964 --> 00:21:28,130
You're fun.

384
00:21:31,067 --> 00:21:32,267
You remember that time...

385
00:21:32,269 --> 00:21:33,468
Remember that time you betrayed me

386
00:21:33,470 --> 00:21:35,036
and got my father executed?

387
00:21:38,307 --> 00:21:39,541
Yeah, I remember.

388
00:21:40,977 --> 00:21:43,478
Where were we? Fun.

389
00:21:43,480 --> 00:21:45,447
Yeah.

390
00:21:45,449 --> 00:21:47,148
Well, since you brought it up,

391
00:21:47,150 --> 00:21:48,817
and I didn't, because

392
00:21:48,819 --> 00:21:51,987
I don't want to talk about it,

393
00:21:51,989 --> 00:21:53,221
what were you thinking?

394
00:21:57,126 --> 00:21:58,793
I made a mistake, Clarke.

395
00:22:02,031 --> 00:22:03,832
"I made a mistake, Clarke."

396
00:22:06,569 --> 00:22:07,969
Not good enough.

397
00:22:11,507 --> 00:22:13,942
You know, I bet

398
00:22:13,944 --> 00:22:16,411
you couldn't wait to run to daddy.

399
00:22:16,413 --> 00:22:17,645
Tell him everything

400
00:22:17,647 --> 00:22:18,980
so that he'd finally believe

401
00:22:18,982 --> 00:22:20,682
you were the perfect son he always wanted.

402
00:22:20,684 --> 00:22:22,150
What do you want me to say?

403
00:22:22,152 --> 00:22:24,185
I want an explanation.

404
00:22:32,227 --> 00:22:33,661
I can't give you one.

405
00:22:35,731 --> 00:22:37,231
I thought I could trust him.

406
00:22:41,837 --> 00:22:44,839
Well, I thought I could
trust my best friend.

407
00:22:44,841 --> 00:22:46,174
Guess we were both wrong.

408
00:22:46,176 --> 00:22:47,475
I'm still your friend.

409
00:22:47,477 --> 00:22:51,012
No, you're not. If you were my friend,

410
00:22:51,014 --> 00:22:53,548
you would walk out into
that fog and never come back.

411
00:22:56,685 --> 00:23:01,088
Ok, how about we just... take it easy.

412
00:23:02,991 --> 00:23:05,292
I have no idea how to do that.

413
00:23:20,742 --> 00:23:22,476
So, we having fun yet?

414
00:23:28,351 --> 00:23:31,418
That kid's driving me crazy.

415
00:23:31,420 --> 00:23:33,254
Can't take this much longer.

416
00:23:33,256 --> 00:23:36,557
Someone needs to shut that kid up.

417
00:23:39,895 --> 00:23:41,628
That's it. I'm ending this.

418
00:23:42,697 --> 00:23:44,465
I heard Bellamy gave him till tomorrow.

419
00:23:44,467 --> 00:23:47,067
Yeah, well, Bellamy isn't here, is he?

420
00:23:47,069 --> 00:23:48,202
The kid's dying anyway.

421
00:23:48,204 --> 00:23:49,603
I'm just getting it over with.

422
00:23:53,107 --> 00:23:54,775
Murphy's going to kill Jasper!

423
00:23:59,714 --> 00:24:00,847
The lock's on the other side.

424
00:24:01,683 --> 00:24:02,883
Don't let him in!

425
00:24:02,885 --> 00:24:04,985
I'm gonna kill him, ok? Let me in!

426
00:24:04,987 --> 00:24:06,520
Let me in, Monty! Uhh!

427
00:24:08,556 --> 00:24:10,824
No rush. I'm fine here.

428
00:24:10,826 --> 00:24:12,025
I got it!

429
00:24:13,328 --> 00:24:14,961
Move it!

430
00:24:14,963 --> 00:24:17,264
Both of you better open
up this hatch right now!

431
00:24:21,644 --> 00:24:23,678
In this time of uncertainty,

432
00:24:23,680 --> 00:24:27,182
we will come together as a people.

433
00:24:27,184 --> 00:24:30,852
I'm telling you this because
you must know the truth

434
00:24:30,854 --> 00:24:35,356
and because I want a future
for my child and yours.

435
00:24:37,159 --> 00:24:39,027
Be strong.

436
00:24:39,029 --> 00:24:40,762
You're gonna disobey the council?

437
00:24:46,068 --> 00:24:49,737
Dad, I know. I heard you and Mom.

438
00:24:49,739 --> 00:24:51,839
Ok, you know.

439
00:24:51,841 --> 00:24:53,574
I've been thinking about this a long time.

440
00:24:53,576 --> 00:24:55,543
The people have a right to know.

441
00:24:55,545 --> 00:24:56,911
Your mother doesn't understand.

442
00:24:56,913 --> 00:24:58,046
What's the plan?

443
00:24:59,581 --> 00:25:01,015
You don't need to know the plan.

444
00:25:01,017 --> 00:25:03,484
You're making a video, so, what?

445
00:25:03,486 --> 00:25:05,153
You're gonna break into

446
00:25:05,155 --> 00:25:06,854
the communications mainframe?

447
00:25:08,891 --> 00:25:10,458
Making you either suicidal

448
00:25:10,460 --> 00:25:11,893
or incredibly dumb.

449
00:25:11,895 --> 00:25:15,196
Wow. You are picking a fine moment

450
00:25:15,198 --> 00:25:17,198
to start behaving like a typical teenager.

451
00:25:17,200 --> 00:25:18,566
- I'm gonna help you.
- No.

452
00:25:18,568 --> 00:25:19,734
No, Clarke, you're not.

453
00:25:19,736 --> 00:25:21,636
- But I can...
- Absolutely not.

454
00:25:23,839 --> 00:25:27,308
No. No, baby.

455
00:25:30,246 --> 00:25:33,247
You get that stubborn streak
from your mother, you know.

456
00:25:33,249 --> 00:25:37,084
One of many things I
love about both of you.

457
00:25:37,086 --> 00:25:39,153
Jake Griffin, you're
under arrest for treason.

458
00:25:39,155 --> 00:25:40,421
Dad? Dad?

459
00:25:40,423 --> 00:25:42,690
No, no, no, no.

460
00:25:42,692 --> 00:25:44,058
Get your hands off of her.

461
00:25:44,060 --> 00:25:45,559
Let me go!

462
00:25:45,561 --> 00:25:46,760
Ohh.

463
00:25:46,762 --> 00:25:48,596
I'll warn them. I'll find a way.

464
00:25:48,598 --> 00:25:51,532
No, Clarke, no, listen to
me. Do not... do not do that.

465
00:25:51,534 --> 00:25:54,535
Get off of me! Let me go!

466
00:25:54,537 --> 00:25:58,005
Let me go! Dad! Dad!

467
00:26:01,076 --> 00:26:03,510
The fog's cleared. Come on.

468
00:26:09,651 --> 00:26:11,585
Let's go. Jasper's waiting.

469
00:26:23,598 --> 00:26:26,200
Last night was pretty intense.

470
00:26:26,202 --> 00:26:27,701
You and Clarke ever...

471
00:26:27,703 --> 00:26:29,870
No. Not like that.

472
00:26:32,106 --> 00:26:34,308
So, help me out.

473
00:26:35,643 --> 00:26:38,512
Your best friend tells you
something fairly explosive.

474
00:26:38,514 --> 00:26:39,780
You seem like the type of guy

475
00:26:39,782 --> 00:26:40,781
that'd keep it to yourself.

476
00:26:40,783 --> 00:26:42,015
You don't know me.

477
00:26:42,017 --> 00:26:43,350
Why'd you do it?

478
00:26:45,620 --> 00:26:47,154
I don't know. Why do you care?

479
00:26:49,123 --> 00:26:50,957
You knew what the rules were on the Ark.

480
00:26:52,026 --> 00:26:54,127
You had to know her dad would get floated.

481
00:26:55,963 --> 00:26:57,964
I made a choice.

482
00:26:57,966 --> 00:26:59,432
If she hates me for the rest of my life,

483
00:26:59,434 --> 00:27:00,634
I made the right choice,

484
00:27:00,636 --> 00:27:02,002
and that's all you have to know.

485
00:27:09,377 --> 00:27:10,744
It's all clear.

486
00:27:14,248 --> 00:27:15,715
Anybody out here?

487
00:27:16,817 --> 00:27:17,851
Jones?

488
00:27:17,853 --> 00:27:19,152
We're here!

489
00:27:23,257 --> 00:27:25,825
Lost you in the stew. Where'd you go?

490
00:27:25,827 --> 00:27:27,227
Made it to a cave down there.

491
00:27:27,229 --> 00:27:28,528
The hell was that?

492
00:27:28,530 --> 00:27:30,697
I don't know. Where's Atom?

493
00:27:36,237 --> 00:27:39,872
Trapped in a 100-year-old
car by toxic fog.

494
00:27:39,874 --> 00:27:43,509
Whew. Last night was pretty...

495
00:27:43,511 --> 00:27:47,480
What's the word? Fun.

496
00:27:47,482 --> 00:27:50,583
It wasn't fun. It was irresponsible.

497
00:27:50,585 --> 00:27:52,118
We should've left the
second the fog cleared.

498
00:27:52,120 --> 00:27:53,786
Even if the fog cleared,

499
00:27:53,788 --> 00:27:55,755
we'd never make it back
through these woods at night.

500
00:27:57,991 --> 00:28:00,059
You were kind of rough on Wells.

501
00:28:00,061 --> 00:28:01,360
Hardly.

502
00:28:02,763 --> 00:28:05,097
He's a pretty straight-up guy.

503
00:28:05,099 --> 00:28:07,967
And he loves you. You know that, right?

504
00:28:09,870 --> 00:28:13,105
But every time your dad comes up,

505
00:28:13,107 --> 00:28:14,740
he won't give you a straight answer.

506
00:28:15,842 --> 00:28:17,410
Makes me think he's hiding something.

507
00:28:18,712 --> 00:28:21,047
So, I gotta ask you.

508
00:28:21,049 --> 00:28:22,281
How sure are you that

509
00:28:22,283 --> 00:28:24,250
Wells is the one who turned in your dad?

510
00:28:24,252 --> 00:28:26,852
100%. All right?

511
00:28:26,854 --> 00:28:28,487
He's the only one I told.

512
00:28:30,891 --> 00:28:32,491
Is he the only one who knew?

513
00:28:38,598 --> 00:28:40,633
Aah!

514
00:28:40,635 --> 00:28:41,901
Who was that?

515
00:28:43,003 --> 00:28:44,503
Aah!

516
00:28:45,972 --> 00:28:47,640
Aah!

517
00:28:53,113 --> 00:28:55,848
Son of a bitch. Atom.

518
00:29:08,761 --> 00:29:12,998
Kill me. Kill me.

519
00:29:15,301 --> 00:29:16,535
Kill me.

520
00:29:39,736 --> 00:29:43,772
I... can't... breathe.

521
00:29:50,313 --> 00:29:51,747
Don't be afraid.

522
00:29:55,118 --> 00:29:56,418
Go back to camp.

523
00:29:59,422 --> 00:30:01,457
Charlotte, you too.

524
00:30:09,833 --> 00:30:11,099
Kill me.

525
00:30:19,943 --> 00:30:25,714
Bellamy, please.

526
00:30:40,430 --> 00:30:41,563
I heard screams.

527
00:30:41,565 --> 00:30:42,964
Charlotte found him.

528
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:45,267
I sent her back to camp.

529
00:31:03,386 --> 00:31:04,552
Ok.

530
00:31:06,188 --> 00:31:08,857
I'm gonna help you, all right?

531
00:32:08,817 --> 00:32:10,851
We've gotta get to Jasper.

532
00:32:10,853 --> 00:32:12,953
I'll need boiled water
to make the medicine.

533
00:32:18,293 --> 00:32:20,294
Get Clarke whatever she needs.

534
00:32:21,930 --> 00:32:24,765
I better go get this grave dug.

535
00:32:24,767 --> 00:32:27,768
It's about time. They're gonna kill Jasper.

536
00:32:27,770 --> 00:32:28,903
Did you get the medicine?

537
00:32:28,905 --> 00:32:29,937
Yeah. I... I got it.

538
00:32:29,939 --> 00:32:31,238
Come on. Let's go talk.

539
00:32:32,908 --> 00:32:36,777
Octavia, just stay
there. Please, stay back.

540
00:32:36,779 --> 00:32:38,212
Stop.

541
00:32:45,220 --> 00:32:46,420
Atom.

542
00:32:48,390 --> 00:32:49,490
There's nothing I could do.

543
00:32:49,492 --> 00:32:50,624
Don't.

544
00:33:02,504 --> 00:33:04,638
- Oh, oh, please.
- Don't.

545
00:33:10,511 --> 00:33:12,479
Lose anyone here?

546
00:33:12,481 --> 00:33:13,614
No.

547
00:33:14,449 --> 00:33:15,449
Jasper?

548
00:33:15,451 --> 00:33:17,084
Still breathing. Barely.

549
00:33:17,086 --> 00:33:20,253
I tried to take him out, but
your psycho little sister...

550
00:33:20,255 --> 00:33:22,823
- Bellamy...
- My what? My what?

551
00:33:23,825 --> 00:33:26,093
Your little sister.

552
00:33:26,095 --> 00:33:29,429
Yeah, that's right. My little sister.

553
00:33:31,432 --> 00:33:33,100
Got anything else you
want to say about her?

554
00:33:35,837 --> 00:33:37,170
Nothing.

555
00:33:38,172 --> 00:33:39,306
Sorry.

556
00:33:44,645 --> 00:33:45,845
Get him out of here.

557
00:34:14,116 --> 00:34:15,250
Hey, baby.

558
00:34:22,224 --> 00:34:23,524
You have to warn them, Abby.

559
00:34:23,526 --> 00:34:25,793
Oh, Jake, stop.

560
00:34:25,795 --> 00:34:28,763
Oh, the Ark's dying. There's no choice.

561
00:34:28,765 --> 00:34:29,931
Yes, there is.

562
00:34:31,333 --> 00:34:32,500
There's Earth.

563
00:34:35,571 --> 00:34:37,438
We'll at least have a chance.

564
00:34:45,480 --> 00:34:47,515
Here. Hang on to that.

565
00:34:48,984 --> 00:34:53,321
And... give this to Clarke
and tell her that I...

566
00:34:53,323 --> 00:34:54,622
Dad!

567
00:34:54,624 --> 00:34:56,490
Clarke, you shouldn't be here, honey.

568
00:34:56,492 --> 00:34:58,993
You don't want to see this.

569
00:34:58,995 --> 00:35:00,127
It's ok.

570
00:35:11,439 --> 00:35:13,307
It's ok. It's ok.

571
00:35:14,342 --> 00:35:17,378
Here. Keep that for me.

572
00:35:19,681 --> 00:35:21,482
Jake, it's time.

573
00:35:29,591 --> 00:35:31,091
I love you, kid.

574
00:35:31,093 --> 00:35:32,326
I love you.

575
00:35:50,545 --> 00:35:51,712
Ok.

576
00:35:55,149 --> 00:35:58,352
Oh, my God.

577
00:36:00,221 --> 00:36:03,256
I'm so sorry.

578
00:36:03,258 --> 00:36:06,760
Sweetheart, it's not your fault.

579
00:36:27,682 --> 00:36:30,250
I'm really sorry about Atom.

580
00:36:34,622 --> 00:36:36,022
I guess we're gonna have to get used to

581
00:36:36,024 --> 00:36:38,058
people dying down here, aren't we?

582
00:36:40,261 --> 00:36:43,063
But not you. You hear me?

583
00:36:43,065 --> 00:36:44,898
You're not allowed to die.

584
00:36:56,644 --> 00:36:57,844
Wells?

585
00:37:03,450 --> 00:37:06,252
I know I probably don't deserve it,

586
00:37:06,254 --> 00:37:07,987
but I need to know the truth.

587
00:37:10,758 --> 00:37:14,127
It was my mom. Wasn't it?

588
00:37:16,096 --> 00:37:17,764
She's the one who told your dad.

589
00:37:21,468 --> 00:37:23,136
I didn't want to believe it. I...

590
00:37:24,471 --> 00:37:25,671
I couldn't.

591
00:37:27,007 --> 00:37:29,075
I blamed you because my father's dead

592
00:37:29,077 --> 00:37:30,877
and it's my mother's fault.

593
00:37:32,713 --> 00:37:33,880
Isn't it?

594
00:37:36,216 --> 00:37:39,819
Wells... Please.

595
00:37:45,325 --> 00:37:46,993
I knew how you would feel.

596
00:37:50,130 --> 00:37:52,298
I wanted to... to protect me.

597
00:38:00,440 --> 00:38:02,007
So, you let me hate you.

598
00:38:03,977 --> 00:38:05,211
What are friends for?

599
00:38:07,013 --> 00:38:08,647
How can you forgive me?

600
00:38:11,585 --> 00:38:13,218
This is already done.

601
00:38:30,303 --> 00:38:32,504
Smooth.

602
00:38:42,315 --> 00:38:45,284
Disgusting. Love it.

603
00:38:47,754 --> 00:38:51,223
Can I, uh, get a hit of that?

604
00:38:51,225 --> 00:38:52,357
Jasper!

605
00:38:52,359 --> 00:38:55,360
Let's start with the soft stuff.

606
00:39:01,634 --> 00:39:03,101
Welcome back, buddy.

607
00:39:08,674 --> 00:39:11,376
Was that a dream or did I get speared?

608
00:39:12,745 --> 00:39:15,380
You'll have a very
impressive scar to prove it.

609
00:39:15,382 --> 00:39:16,982
My savior.

610
00:39:17,850 --> 00:39:21,686
Thank you for not dying.

611
00:39:21,688 --> 00:39:23,755
I don't think I could've taken that today.

612
00:39:24,757 --> 00:39:26,725
I'll try not to die tomorrow, too,

613
00:39:26,727 --> 00:39:27,826
if that's cool.

614
00:39:31,464 --> 00:39:32,764
Oh, hello.

615
00:39:53,852 --> 00:39:55,853
Hi.

616
00:39:55,855 --> 00:39:57,021
Couldn't sleep?

617
00:39:58,257 --> 00:39:59,624
I never can.

618
00:40:00,859 --> 00:40:03,094
You on watch?

619
00:40:03,096 --> 00:40:04,195
Join me.

620
00:40:11,103 --> 00:40:12,603
I had a nightmare.

621
00:40:12,605 --> 00:40:14,972
Hmm.

622
00:40:14,974 --> 00:40:17,942
I... I have them every night.

623
00:40:20,646 --> 00:40:26,450
But... I think I found
a way to make them stop.

624
00:40:29,554 --> 00:40:30,821
I'm sorry.

625
00:40:32,257 --> 00:40:34,458
No!

626
00:40:52,477 --> 00:40:54,678
Every night, I see him.

627
00:40:56,147 --> 00:40:57,381
Your father.

628
00:40:58,683 --> 00:41:02,853
He kills my parents
and... and I see his face

629
00:41:02,855 --> 00:41:06,156
and... and I wake up and I see yours.

630
00:41:07,959 --> 00:41:10,828
And the nightmare never ends.

631
00:41:10,830 --> 00:41:13,664
The only way to make it end was...

632
00:41:13,666 --> 00:41:15,833
was to slay my demons.

633
00:41:17,602 --> 00:41:19,103
I had to.
